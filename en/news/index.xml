      <description>The complainant asked Karvinská Mining Hospital a.s. (hereinafter “KHN, a. s.”) for the assessment whether he suffers from occupational diseases or not. KHN a.s. elaborated the medical report on the non-recognition of occupational diseases in the complainant’s case and asked him to pay CZK 2,000 for issuing the report. The complainant refused to pay the amount in question since he was convinced that this medical assessment shall be covered by the health insurance.</description>

      <title>Complaint against the excessive length of proceedings is well-founded, even if the state is liable, not the judge</title>

      <description>In one of the recent cases, the complainant objected that even after one year and a half of the divorce proceedings, the motion was not served to the opposing party. However, the court found his complaint against delays unreasonable since the judge could not be held liable for the delays. The reasons for the excessive length of the proceedings lied in the problems with the certified translation into an exotic language of the applicant&#39;s wife because there was only one interpreter authorised for the translation of the language.</description>

      <description>The legal action to protect public interest against the decision of the Olomouc Municipality concerning the placement of the Šantovka Tower was filed by the former Ombudswoman Anna Šabatová. Several laws were violated according the action: The Act on the State Heritage Protection, the Act on Nature and Landscape Protection, the Administrative Code, the Construction Act, as well as the Czech Republic&#39;s obligations under the Convention on the Protection of the Architectural Heritage of Europe.</description>

      <title>Presenting a valid and undamaged insurance card is not a precondition for providing healthcare in a prison</title>

      <description>The complainant came to the prison’s healthcare centre with flu-like symptoms. The insurance card which he submitted was partially damaged and had an illegible expiry date. The physician refused to treat him because he had failed to comply with the duty to present a health insurance card as required by the head of the given department, and at the same time, the physician had concluded that his medical condition did not require urgent treatment.</description>

      <description>As the Deputy stated, current situation did not interrupt handling of written complaints of prisoners. She already received several complaints from prisoners regarding the conduct of the Prison Service in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the Deputy turned to the General Directorate of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic to find out what measures have been taken to prevent the spread of the disease and how prisoners and the staff are protected.</description>

      <title>Assistance in material need is not subject to debt collection procedures</title>

      <description>By mistake, the labour office did not pay a benefit under assistance in material need to the complainant by means of a postal order, but rather sent it to her attached bank account. The bank immediately transferred it to the competent municipal authority, which, as the tax administrator, ordered its attachment with a view to collecting an outstanding local fee for municipal waste. The complainant asked for a refund of the benefit but the municipal authority dismissed her request three times in spite of a confirmation issued by the labour office that the amount in question represented assistance in material need, which cannot be subject to attachment.</description>

      <description>Monika Šimůnková, the Deputy Ombudsman, and her colleagues dealt with several cases concerning negative impacts of government’s emergency measures on families. In cases in question, married couples coming from different countries were to be separated by the temporarily closed borders. Fortunately, in all cases mentioned bellow the Deputy and her colleagues were able to help them.
The first case was related to the partners living each at the opposite side of the Czech-Slovak boarders.</description>

      <title>The Ombudsman called on the Prime Minister to take an action against the unprofessionalism of the Ministry of Regional Development</title>

      <description>First of all, the Ombudsman objected that the actions taken by the Ministry – giving only 5 working days to the stakeholders to submit their legislative comments to the Act when significant changes were made in the proposal – contradicts the Legislative Rules of the Government. In the end, this approach makes the inter-departmental review inapplicable in its full extend and it forces the stakeholders to keep their comments at the minimum.</description>

      <title>People over 75 years of age cannot be excluded from a public opinion poll which is to replace a local referendum</title>

      <description>The complainant challenged steps taken by the Statutory City of Ostrava on the grounds of discrimination against elderly people as the city had excluded people over 75 years of age from a public opinion poll regarding a plan for the construction of new tram tracks in the district of Ostrava-Poruba. The Mayor of Ostrava repeatedly described this poll in the media as a “cheaper alternative to a local referendum”.
The Defender sent a letter to the Mayor of Ostrava where she stated that it was inadmissible to set an upper age limit for a public opinion poll that was to replace a local referendum, also because these people would have the right to vote in a possible referendum.</description>

      <description>The complainant, a Czech citizen, left the country in 1987. In 1995, when he returned to the Czech Republic to obtain a passport, the municipal authority issued to him a certificate of citizenship, where it stated Australia as his place of residence (while knowing the exact address). But it did not cancel his permanent address in the Czech Republic in the population records, although when a certificate is issued to citizens living permanently abroad, their residence in the Czech Republic is considered temporary.</description>

      <description>Within Article 27 of the Convention (work and employment), we conducted a survey focusing on mapping the conditions of and impediments to employment of people with disabilities in the public sector. Indeed, we assume that public administration should lead by example in creating appropriate working conditions for employees with disabilities.
Using a questionnaire survey and personal interviews, we wanted to obtain a better idea about the situation on the ground, approaches to employment of people with disabilities and the actual accessibility of workplaces, specific jobs for people with disabilities in the public sector, as well as the possibilities of making reasonable adjustments.</description>

      <guid>https://ochrance-preview.netlify.app/en/aktualne/fair-unemployment-benefits-even-without-the-employers-confirmation/</guid>
      <description>The Ombudsman dealt with the case in which the employer failed to issue any documents to the complainant following termination of her employment. She was thus unable to prove her average monthly net earnings and the labour office granted her unemployment benefits in the minimum amount. Later, she managed to obtain copies of her payslips from the employer’s accounts. She therefore asked the labour office to increase the benefits and pay the outstanding amounts retroactively.</description>

      <description>Systematic visits and monitoring of expulsion We visited five facilities and monitored one administrative expulsion of a foreign national, specifically from the Facility for Detention of Foreigners in Bělá-Jezová via Václav Havel Airport in Prague.
We initiated a new series of visits focusing on social services facilities – special regime homes providing care to persons with reduced self-reliance due to a chronic mental illness or addiction to dependency producing substances. The first visited facility was Domov ve Věži in the Vysočina region.</description>

      <description>On application of a body for social and legal protection of children (BSLPC), the court issued a preliminary injunction whereby it removed a child from his tutors and placed him in a diagnostic institution. The BSLPC failed to discuss the situation with the tutors forthwith after the decision was made, did not inform them of further steps, and failed to co-operate with them. Based on a mere notice from the Police of the Czech Republic, i.</description>

      <description>A Muslim girl of Somali origin was unable to study at the Secondary Medical School in Prague because she insisted on wearing a hijab. The Defender concluded that the provision of the school regulations which prohibited the wearing of headdress was indirectly discriminatory on the grounds of religion. The Supreme Court (File No. 25 Cdo 348/2019) confirmed the Defender’s opinion and ruled that a prohibition covering religious headdress worn during theoretical courses at a school did not pursue any legitimate objective.</description>

      <description>The Ombudsman dealt with the case in which the health insurance company informed the complainant of a debt in the amount of CZK 1,080 (for one month) for the first time more than five years after it arose. The penalty for that period had already exceeded the debt itself. The insurance company did not inform the complainant that she could apply for waiver of the penalty after having paid the outstanding premiums.</description>

      <description>It has been 10 years since the Anti-Discrimination Act entered into force. For this occasion, the ombudswoman organized a student documentary film competition called Equal.doc. The aim of the competition was to find out how young people view the issues of equality and discrimination.
Students aged fifteen to nineteen from all around the country were asked to produce a short (10 min. maximum) documentary film about equality or discrimination. The main prize was screening of the winning documentary at Summer Film School Uherské Hradiště and the awards ceremony itself at the Office of the Ombudswoman.</description>

      <description>This year marks the 10th anniversary of the time when the Anti-Discrimination Act entered into force and when the Defender was also given the role of the national equality body pursuant to the European Union legislation. Since the Defender lacks the power to represent victims of discrimination in court, lawyers play the key role in this respect. Therefore, the Defender has prepared a document to help them with this task. In addition to recommendations and a summary of specific cases that the Defender referred to the Pro Bono Aliance to arrange for legal representation, the text further includes an analysis of a survey focusing on the assessment of the lawyers’ experience with representing victims of discrimination.</description>

      <description>The complainant placed in a remand prison cell described his cell as a “toilet with a camera”. Allegedly, the camera was only a few meters away from the toilet and made a 24/7 recording. Although it was supposed to have a night-vision technology, the guards would turn on the lights five times a night during the patrol, thus waking up the prisoners. It was not possible to determine the actual use of the camera in the complainant’s case.</description>

There are four annual reports: the general Annual Report describing all the most important activities of the Ombudsman in the previous year, and the specialized reports &amp;ndash; the NPM Annual Report, the Summary Report on Protiection Against Discrimination, and the Report on Monitoring Rights of People with Disabilities.

      <description>The Ombudsman dealt with the case of a mother whose three small children were removed away from her care as it had been found that she had been neglecting them. The court placed them in a children’s home. The mother tried to sort out her life, started a relationship with a new partner and found herself suitable accommodation. She wanted to be in contact with her children. She regularly spoke with them on the phone and visited them in the children’s home.</description>

      <title>Unclear pleadings of debtors subject to a tax enforcement procedure</title>

      <guid>https://ochrance-preview.netlify.app/en/aktualne/unclear-pleadings-of-debtors-subject-to-a-tax-enforcement-procedure/</guid>
      <description>The tax authority attached the entire balance of salary paid to a debtor by his former employer. The authority treated a pleading whereby the debtor questioned the lawfulness of this procedure as an objection. However, the deadline for filing an objection (30 days) had already expired, and it therefore rejected the objection without material review. In fact, the pleading should have been treated as an application for discontinuing the enforcement procedure.</description>

      <description>The Ombudsman dealt with the application of the complainant who obtained a Master of Sciences degree in the United Kingdom in the field of Information and Communication Technology. However, the relevant authority refused to include the abbreviation of the degree (MSc or MSc.) in the complainant’s identity card because it had not been stated by the school in his diploma.
Under the current legislation, an abbreviation of the obtained academic degree cannot be stated in a citizen’s identity card if a foreign university or college does not specify an abbreviation of the relevant academic degree in a diploma it issues.</description>

      <title>The Czech Ombudsman fights for the improvement in publication of court decisions</title>

      <guid>https://ochrance-preview.netlify.app/en/aktualne/the-czech-ombudsman-fights-for-the-improvement-in-publication-of-court-decisions/</guid>
      <description>Public access to court case-law contributes to predictable decision-making by the courts, unification of the decision-making practice and transparency of court decisions, and thus also to promotion of the right to a fair trial. The Ministry of Justice has to provide for proper functioning of online records of court case-law.
During a 2016 survey (520.5 kB, Adobe Acrobat document), the Ombudsman found that the relevant records were basically not functioning. The public part comprised only 2,875 decisions.</description>

      <description>In autumn 2018, the Czech Ombudswoman together with the Prague Pride Association conducted one of the largest surveys among lesbians, gays, bisexuals and trans people in the Czech Republic. The research’s outcomes were presented on the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia on 17 May 2019 and the results were also made available on the Ombudsman’s website. As to the main findings of the survey, it found out that almost ¾ of the LGBT+ people in the Czech Republic believe that the members of their community are discriminated.</description>

      <guid>https://ochrance-preview.netlify.app/en/aktualne/construction-authorities-will-begin-removing-dangerous-buildings/</guid>
      <description>Where a building suffers from fundamental defects, the construction authority will require that its owner provide for a remedy. If the owner then fails to act, the authority will have to enforce its decision. Although the enforcement costs are borne by the owner, they often cannot be collected.
The construction authorities have thus long failed to enforce their decisions because they lacked the money required to this end. The unsustainability of this practice was already pointed out by Mr Otakar Motejl (former Defender) in 2004.</description>

      <title>Czech Ombudswoman: the fee of CZK 10.000 for the notification addressed to the Office for the Protection of Competition about the potentially unlawful public procurement procedure is unconstitutional</title>

      <description>In 2016, the Office for the Protection of Competition (the antimonopoly authority, further referred also as “OPC”) proposed to introduce the fee of CZK 10.000 (EUR 390) for an application to initiate ex officio proceedings in respect of each challenged public contract. The OPC claimed that the possibility to notify the potential unlawfulness of the public procurement procedure in concrete cases was overused in the practice. As a result, the OPC was overloaded by applications which caused its ineffectiveness.</description>

      <description>The Polish Commissioner for Human Rights („Ombudsman“) has also been entrusted by the functions of the national human rights institution (NHRI) in Poland – the institution whose task is to monitor, promote and protect human rights. Furthermore, the Ombudsman was designated the task of NPM (National Preventive Mechanism) under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degarading Treatment or Punishment (OPCAT) by the parliament in 1987.</description>

      <description>The Defender inquired into a complaint where the complainant alleged that his employer was discriminating against employees because of their age. Allegedly, employees over 65 years of age were being offered less favourable contracts as concerned their term, number of working hours and sources of funding. The complainant filed a complaint against unequal treatment at the District Labour Inspectorate. Shortly after the employer learnt about this fact, it informed the complainant that his contract would not be extended.</description>

      <description>In recent years, the Czech Ombudsman repeatedly warned about shortcomings in the procedure of the Ministry of Education (hereinafter “the Ministry”) in reviewing the results of school-leaving examinations (the “maturita” exam used in numerous types of secondary schools). Based on the Ombudsman’s comments, the Ministry has amended the so-called “maturita decree” and modified certain procedures and forms so that the students would now have better information on where and how to lodge a complaint.</description>

      <description>Since 2015, the Czech Ombudsman has been dealing with complaints filed by applicants for disabled parking permits in the city of Brno against being denied a permit (“permit for a special use of road” under Czech laws) by a city ward.
Following consultations with the individual city wards, Brno City Hall (hereinafter the “City Hall”) issued a recommended methodology; some city wards then adopted their own methodology while others chose to use the one recommended by the City Hall.</description>

      <description>In November 2015, a patient died at the psychiatric clinic in Olomouc during police intervention where a Taser (TASER X26) was used; the police was called in by the medical staff to help restrain the patient who was behaving dangerously due a psychotic seizure. The Ombudswoman decided to take her own initiative and to inquire into the case. The aim of her examination was to make clear whether it was necessary to use force to restrain the patient.</description>

      <description>The Ombudswoman dealt with the matter concerning the rejection of job candidates who were not willing to make an agreement with the employer that their salary would be sent to their bank account. In other words, they preferred to be paid by cash. First of all, it must be stressed that sending a salary to a bank account is a matter of agreement between the employee and the employer. Excluding candidates who do not wish to make such an agreement could lead to them being indirectly discriminated against on grounds of property.</description>

A survey conducted last year by Rozalio, an association dealing with vaccination policy, called attention to disparate reimbursement practices on the part of public health insurance companies with regard to postponed vaccination. The opinion of the Ministry of Health presented on the association’s website was rejected by multiple health insurance companies, including the General Health Insurance Company of the Czech Republic (Všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna České republiky).</description>

      <description>The Deputy Ombudsman inquired into the manner of resolution of a complaint against an inappropriate conduct of a judge of the Regional Court in Ostrava. The complaint was directed against, inter alia, the presiding judge of the appellate chamber, who had prohibited the complainant from making a video recording of the hearing because “he was nervous when filmed”. The complainant also objected to the composition of the appellate chamber. The president of the court concluded that the complaint was substantively unfounded but noted that the complainant’s submission expressed his disagreement with the procedure and decision of the appellate chamber and potential remedies could be sought by means specified by relevant procedural rules.</description>

      <description>The Ombudswoman dealt with the matter concerning potentially discriminatory practices in case of advertising job offers only in a foreign language.
It follows from her Opinion that job offers made by companies only in a foreign language in themselves constitute neither discrimination on grounds of ethnicity, nor denial of the right to employment on the grounds of language. Exclusive use of the Czech language in public space is not required under any law.</description>

      <description>The Czech Ombudsman was approached by some of the applicants for study programmes in education with hearing impairments who faced certain obstacles during the application process for the respective studies. Therefore, the Ombudswoman decided to approach eight public faculties of education with several enquiries. After the evaluation of the answers from the perspective of legal regulations concerning equal treatment, the Ombudswoman came to the following conclusions: Accessibility of study programmes to students with hearing impairments in the Czech Republic differs at the individual faculties of education.</description>

      <description>The Ombudswoman received a complaint from a man who had been severely physically and mentally ill since his childhood with no hope to ever recover. His disability pension has been for years very low (about CZK 3,000/EUR 120 per month) which was the reason why he decided to turn to the Ombudsman. During the inquiry of the Ombudswoman, several deficiencies in the process of assessment of the severity of the man’s illness were found.</description>

      <description>The first recommendations on equal access to preschool education were issued already in 2010 by then Ombudsman Pavel Varvařovský. They were his response to complaints raised by parents whose children had not been admitted to a kindergarten. Kindergarten headteachers were making decisions based on criteria the parents considered discriminatory. Consequently, the aim of the recommendations was to assess the most commonly applied criteria in terms of their compliance with the law.</description>

      <description>Restitution, that is, the return of confiscated property only partly falls under the ombudsman&#39;s authority. The ombudsman can deal with the cases only if they concern land offices’ proceedings.
&amp;quot;The people who turn to us either disagree with the rejection of their restitution claim or they believe they can have some claim inherited from their ancestors,&amp;quot; Krecek said and added: “The restitution claim must have been raised in time, which is no longer possible at present.</description>

      <description>Effective from 1 December 2017, the statutory rules for payment of subsistence support benefits have changed. The labour office must mandatorily pay at least 35% of the benefits to persons who are in material need for longer than 6 months in the form of vouchers for purchase of goods at the specified value. The vouchers are only intended for people in material need and are clearly marked as such (i.e. differently from standard meal vouchers issued as an employee benefit).</description>

She claimed that the home was forcing her to enrol in a secondary school she did not want to attend. Attending the secondary school also entailed living in a boarding house, which was far from the children’s home and the girl would thus not be able to attend the same school as her sister who had already reached the age of majority.</description>

      <description>The main findings of the research show that:
There are certain standard measures applied in the area of work-life balance at the Ministries which make it easier to combine work and out-of-work duties of the employees; there are, however, differences among the individual Ministries;there are discrepancies in the position and responsibilities of the “gender focal points” at the Ministries. Their position in terms of the organisational structure of their respective Ministries differs (assignment to a section, department, or unit) and they usually do not devote a sufficient part of their work capacity to the topic of gender equality, which also includes work-life balance;the Ministries often use only some of the available forms of flexible work and there were significant differences in the provision of certain other benefits;only flexible scheduling of working time is available everywhere; in contrast, shorter working time or work from other places are only available to a few percent of civil servants, even though many more are interested.</description>

      <description>This innovation provoked a critical reaction from several men who felt to be discriminated on the basis of their sex. Some of them decided to fill a complaint to the Ombudsman (at that time the office was held by Pavel Varvařovský) who came to conclusion that this measure had a legitimate aim (increased feeling of safety of women passengers) which was proportional, and therefore lawful.
After a few years, the Ombudswoman, Anna Šabatová, had to deal with this issue again after she received another two complaints from male passengers complaining about the discriminatory nature of Ladies’ coupés.</description>

The problematic cases concern mostly parents who live in a different EU Member State than they actually work and ask for family benefits in one of these states. The applicants usually wait for months, even years until their claims are processed by the public authorities.</description>

      <description>Education matters. It shapes our identities, develops our social skills, defines our career chances. As such, it is one of the most crucial human rights we all have. Yet, a number of European countries continue to discriminate against groups of children, in particular Roma children, children with disabilities and children of migrant origin, by providing them with education in segregated settings. For years the system in the Czech Republic followed this same wrong pattern.</description>

      <title>Fences around a farm as possible interference with the appearance of the landscape</title>

      <description>The deputy-ombudsman&#39;s inquiry confirmed that the complainants had started the construction works on the fences without an appropriate permit by the Construction Authority (as well as at variance with the spatial plan), which necessarily had had to lead to proceedings on removal of the structure. The deputy critically noted that the proceedings on removal of a structure had not required the spatial planning process, and if the Construction Authority had stayed the proceedings on such grounds, its procedure had been wrong.</description>

      <description>Deputy Ombudsman learned from publicly available information sources about a protest of numerous citizens of Česká Třebová against a structure overshadowing the St. Catherine Rotunda, a protected monument. The citizens complained against the structure by lodging a petition in which they argued that the structure overshadowed the heritage site, which had used to be the dominant feature of the hill. They expected a simple reconstruction of a house, yet the construction works were much larger in scope.</description>

      <description>“It is degrading if all provisionally detained persons had to strip naked and in some cases got toilet paper or a toothbrush only when they asked for it,” said Ombudsman Anna Šabatova at the press conference concerning her report of police cells.
The Ombudsman criticises that the police have no internal rules defining under what conditions body searches should be performed and how they should be performed on the detained people.</description>

      <description>Some 5000 children annually switch between hockey clubs in the Czech Republic. Their parents often pay a high compensation in the form of a sponsor&#39;s gift to the new club. It sends the money to the original club that is entitled to it unless the clubs agree on a free transfer.
The clubs charge 35,000 for a sixth grader, aged about 11-12 years, and 70,000 crowns for an eighth grader, aged 14-15 years.</description>

      <description>The Ombudsman has initiated an inquiry on her own initiative to investigate the conditions for performance of protective treatment, specifically the justification and scope of regime measures, the justification and scope of placement in an isolation room, exercise of the right of access to the courts, handling of personal belongings and the behaviour of the hospital’s medical staff after the patient’s inclusion in one of the so-called remote monitoring groups.</description>

      <description>The Ombudsman dealt with a case of an 18-year-old man who was ordered institutional care by court when he was a minor. After coming of legal age, he entered into an Agreement on Voluntary Stay with the children’s home. He stayed at the home for about six month on the basis of said Agreement, then he terminated the Agreement and left the children’s home. At the same time, he withdrew from his studies.</description>

      <description>The Complainant complained against the procedure of the town of Znojmo in processing her application for issuance of a parking card that would have allowed her to park her vehicle in the paid parking zone defined by a municipal regulation. In her complaint, the Complainant stated that she owned a specific real estate in the city. The city informed her that pursuant to the regulation concerning the issuance of parking cards, only a natural person with his/her permanent address within the defined area was allowed to apply for the issuance of a parking card.</description>

Most complaints were related to social security (399 complaints); many complaints (159) concerned the area of construction proceedings and spatial planning and also the prison system, police and the army (125).
In 88 of the complaints received, the Complainants claimed unequal treatment by public administration and private individuals. The number of complaints directed against discrimination within the meaning of the Anti-Discrimination Act reached 63.</description>

      <description>The Ombudsman was approached by a mother who had given birth as a minor while she lived in a children’s home. She lived with the child in the children’s home until attaining majority. She and the child then moved in with her partner and father of the child. The child was institutionalised soon after the mother attained legal age but the mother cared for the child on the basis of long-term “leaves” from the children’s home.</description>

      <description>The complainants in the case opposed a decision of the Smiřice Municipal Authority which granted an application for a change of surname to the surname of their sister/daughter (the applicant had caused the death of the complainants’ sister/daughter and had been sentenced to 16 years custodial sentence for that act) and disagreed with a communication of the Regional Authority of the Hradec Králové Region which had not found any reasons for initiating review proceedings in this matter.</description>

      <description>After being alerted of this phenomenon several times, the Ombudsman started an inquiry on her own initiative into the procedure of the Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting (hereinafter the “Council”) in the case of a competition announcement by a radio station, which invited listeners to make videos of “pranks” – meaning, in this particular context, videos showing teachers in unexpected and embarrassing situations staged by students.
The Council originally maintained that the matter was beyond its mandate as it was not competent to supervise YouTube, i.</description>

      <description>The Ombudsman examined the filing of a complainant who referred to the inconsistent procedure of the District Labour Inspectorate which, on the basis of the complainant’s petition for the inspection of the employer, learned of the breach of the employer’s labour-law duties and ordered the employer to remedy the shortcomings ascertained during the inspection. However, the District Labour Inspectorate did not impose any fine on the employer for an administrative offence, not even after inspections carried out repeatedly in the past.</description>

      <description>The Public Defender of Rights (Ombudsman) was approached by a man who complained about the fact that the Capital City of Prague’s advertising regulations include exemptions that confer advantages to Prague in comparison with other natural and legal persons. The regulation in question prohibits advertising in a specific area (the Prague Heritage Reservation and the surrounding area) on the grounds of its general inappropriateness in a location of this type; therefore, the person of the advertiser should be of no consequence.</description>

      <description>Kubikova said offices&#39; wrongdoing was found in three cases.
The biggest number of applications for help are mainly filed by young people aged 13 to 19, while younger children are no exception.
Sabatova considers these cases priority ones.
Iva Hrazdilkova, spokeswoman for the office, said children seek advice mainly in their relations to their family and the consequences of the disintegration of the family, which is also true of stays in facilities for children.</description>

      <description>Police officers made a serious mistake when they did not interfere against some supporters of the Chinese president who were beating a man carrying a Tibetan flag with their flagpoles, and instead, they interfered against the victim of the attack and detained him.
The Ombudsman calls on the police to make video-recordings of similar events to be able to assess the situation retroactively and identify some protagonists.
Upon the Chinese president&#39;s arrival, two activists tied themselves up to city light poles, changing Chinese flags for Tibetan ones in Evropska street, the main route from the airport.</description>

      <description>Over the last few years, the Public Defender of Rights received many complaints by persons who were, for instance, not allowed to enter certain buildings or public transport vehicles with their assistance dogs. Some complainants faced the same obstacles in receiving spa treatment or in their places of employment. Specially trained guide dogs help remove, mitigate or overcome the effects of disability. Their purpose is to compensate for a certain handicap.</description>

      <description>The Defender was approached by a complainant who studied at a higher vocational school in the field of “Nutritional Assistant”. She claimed that during the lessons, the teachers forced her to taste meat dishes, although they knew she was a vegetarian. The complainant considered the teachers’ pressure unacceptable and she felt she was being discriminated against on the grounds of her world view (i.e. vegetarianism). The Defender has therefore inquired into the question whether vegetarianism is a world view and whether forcing somebody to taste meat dishes could be qualified as indirect discrimination in access to education on the grounds of a person’s world view.</description>

      <description>The complainant agreed with mediation, the mother of the child did not. The mother and father have been involved in a long-term parental conflict. The first-instance authority based its decision on, inter alia, the experts’ recommendations concerning the suitability of mediation. The City Hall annulled the decision of the first-instance administrative authority and referred the case back for a new hearing, stating that the mother could not have afforded the services of a mediator, recommended to seek an unpaid service, and ordered both parents to attend family counselling.</description>

      <description>In the 2nd quarter, the Defender examined one of the aspects of delays in court proceedings. These are sometimes prolonged due to delays in the preparation of expert reports, which the court needs in certain cases to make a decision. The Defender inquired into this issue in connection with a case of the body of social and legal protection of children (BSLPC) acting as the guardian ad litem. She informed the relevant BSLPC on what possibilities it had in case of failure to comply with the term of preparation of the expert reports.</description>

      <description>If two people do the same work, it is not permissible if one receives lower pay just because he or she has a disability and receives disability pension. Such discrimination represents a violation of the Labour Code as well as the Anti-Discrimination Act. The Labour Code stipulates a duty for the employers to provide the employees with equal pay for equal work. Anti-Discrimination Act prohibits unequal treatment of employees on the grounds of disability.</description>

They should have the adequate powers so that they could effectively protect all victims of discrimination.

      <description>Enrolment in primary school is an important day in the lives of all children, yet it also brings certain possible complications for the parents and headteachers. However, the Schools Act must be observed at all times. In reaction to a growing number of complaints and queries the Defender received in 2015 from parents, non-profit organisations and local governments, she decided to issue a set of recommendations in this area to help parents and headteachers of the relevant school to resolve ambiguous situations.</description>

      <description>(with CTK) However, Petra Suplerova, head of the family and healthcare section, pointed out at the press conference, that the figures cannot be generalised. She explained that the Ombudsman&#39;s Office does not monitor the work of the OSPOD in the whole Czech Republic, but it only deals with complaints against OSPOD‘s work filed by parents or other possible persons.
According to the Ombudsman, the overall cooperation with the OSPOD can be assessed positively.</description>

      <description>The Defender was approached by a complainant objecting against the procedure of her employer (a university), who, despite the fact the complainant worked there for twelve years, extended her employment contract for only a single year, where usually employment contracts were extended by three or even five years in some cases. By the end of 2014, when the complainant’s employment terminated, all older employees of the department where the complainant worked had been let go.</description>

      <description>The ombudsman inquired into the case of a complainant who objected against the rate of disability pension he received on the grounds of his 3rd degree disability (CZK 4,691). The underlying documents clearly showed that the pension was calculated “ordinarily”. When granting the disability pension, the Czech Social Security Administration (hereinafter the “CSSA”) did not use the statutory favourable (fictitious) per cent rate granted to insured persons who are under 28 years of age and were thus unable to attain earnings in their previous careers that could serve as the base for calculation of the pension.</description>

      <description>In the past quarter, the Defender examined the legality of the generally binding ordinance of the city of Karlovy Vary concerning gambling. The City Hall did not by itself specify the places where gambling was to be allowed; it left the choice to the Union of Gambling Industry (in Czech: Unie herního průmyslu). However, the power to regulate gambling belongs to the municipalities, not to the Union of Gambling Industry or any other private entity.</description>

      <description>The Defender believes it unjust if people performing the same work or work of a similar value receive different pay, either due to their gender, disability or the fact they also receive old-age pension. Unequal pay is undignified and the government should do more to prevent it.
Therefore, the Defender recommended to the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs and the State Labour Inspectorate to approach gender experts and prepare guidelines for the District Labour Inspectorates on how to verify gender equality in pay.</description>

      <description>In 2012, the Public Defender of Rights contested the final administrative decisions by which the Duchcov Municipal Authority had permitted the construction of a photovoltaic power plant in the land-registry territory of Moldava in Krušné hory and, subsequently, had approved the structure for use.
The Defender found multiple errors in the administrative proceedings, since the environmental impact of this industrial structure had not been assessed in advance. Furthermore, the Construction Code had been flagrantly breached because the construction project had been permitted and carried out in an undeveloped free landscape and, hence, at variance with one of the basic principles of construction-law regulations, i.</description>

      <description>The complainant, a Czech national, and his wife, a USA national, had a child born in Vrchlabí (Czech Republic), whom they named Thymian based on their affirmative declaration. The Registry office issued a birth certificate which stated “unknown” in the section “Name(s) of the child”. The Registry received the parent’s request to indicate Thymian as the name included in the book of births. The Registry then requested that the parents submit an expert’s opinion and ordered a stay of the proceedings.</description>

The children were placed in a children’s home. The complainant objected to the BSLPC’s order to place the children in institutional care.

The publicly available information suggested that the Construction Code may have been breached since the construction modifications of the street-facing façade had altered the appearance of the building without this being permitted by the competent construction authority. In this case, the authority competent to ensure compliance with the duties under the Construction Code was the Olomouc City Hall (hereinafter the “Construction Authority”).</description>

      <description>A complainant filed his complained already in 2011, where he pleaded violation of the right to equal treatment. He complained that his previous employer decided during a board meeting to reduce personal bonuses by 50 % to all workers with a parallel employment relationship. This measure affected also persons receiving old-age pension. The complainant considered this measure to be an instance of indirect discrimination on the grounds of age.

      <description>A complainant objected against the procedure of the Labour Office of the Czech Republic, the regional branch in Ústí nad Labem, which asked the complainant to produce a certificate of inclusion in the register of jobseekers, the decision on provision of unemployment relief, and notice of the amount of housing allowance in order to evaluate the complainant’s entitlement to subsistence support. However, the Labour Office can obtain all this information from the official records.</description>

      <description>A total of 2128 complaints were received in the first quarter of 2015, which is 102 more than in the same period last year. The number of complaints in the area of public administration has increased– the 1319 complaints received represent an increase of 184 compared to the third quarter of 2014. The percentage of complaints about matters outside the Defender’s mandate delimited by the Public Defender of Rights Act has decreased slightly (809, i.</description>

      <description>The Defender agreed with the conclusion that if a senior employee can be removed under the Labour Code, the employer can generally do so at any time, for any reason and even without giving a reason. However, the Defender emphasised that, even in such a situation, the employer was bound by the duty of non-discrimination and could therefore not remove an employee on discriminatory grounds, for example on grounds of maternity.</description>

      <description>In the given case, the Defender criticised the fact that the Nové Sedlo Prison had been preventing the complainant’s relocation on the grounds that he was, or was expected to be, assigned to work in that prison. In one of these cases, the application for relocation was dismissed by the Nové Sedlo Prison without any substantiation.
An identical case related to the Nové Sedlo Prison (dismissal of an application for relocation substantiated by the assignment to work) was addressed also by the previous Defender.</description>

      <description>The Labour Office of the Czech Republic removed a job seeker from the records of job seekers on the grounds of non-fulfilment of the conditions stipulated in his individual action plan as he had failed to appear for an information meeting. The job seeker objected in the administrative proceedings that he was suffering from memory impairment, which he documented by psychological evaluation, and that this was the reason why he failed to appear for the meeting in time.</description>

      <description>Ombudsman Anna Sabatova has turned to the judiciary to look into the suspected cases of maltreatment of seniors in homes for elderly, including restrictions of their personal freedom, bad nourishment, suspicious use of medicines and other serious flaws. The ombudsman uncovered shortcomings in four homes for elderly, none of which is officially registered for providing social care, and she proposed that the state attorneys check of two of them on suspicion of crime.</description>

      <description>The competences of the Public Defender of Rights as an equality body include the issue of discrimination and assistance to victims of discrimination. In this respect, the traditional “Ombudsman” role of the Defender, consisting in protecting persons from maladministration, is supplemented with another area of activity. The area of work and employment is one of the most important areas where discrimination is forbidden. The issue of balancing work and private life is discussed in particular with respect to employment of women with children and their overall position in the labour market.</description>

      <description>The Treaty on the Functioning of the EU gives the right to participate in municipal elections to all citizens of the European Union who are long-term residents in the Czech Republic and have obtained a certificate of temporary residence. Considering that they are often deprived of this right in practice, the Public Defender of Rights initiated a meeting with the Minister of the Interior and recommended that the rules of participation of EU citizens with temporary residence in the Czech Republic should already be changed for this year’s municipal elections.</description>

      <description>The Defender was approached by a complainant requesting that I investigate the circumstances of his stay in a police cell at the Břeclav District Police Department. Her investigation of the complaint covered the conditions of the stay as well as the manner in which the Regional Directorate of the Police of the South Moravian Region handled the complaint of the person detained in the cell.
After being detained by the Police of the Czech Republic, the complainant was transported for medical examination during which his underwear was damaged and the Police failed to offer him substitute clothes after placing him in the cell (although such clothes are available for this purpose), with the explanation that persons detained in a cell should explicitly request this.</description>

      <description>The draft largely plays into the hands of commercial health insurance companies while it does not integrate foreigners in the system of public health insurance. On the ombudsman’s opinion the draft of the bill should not be passed.
At the press conference the ombudsman said the integration of foreigners in the system of public health insurance would help not only foreigners staying in the country, but also the state and health facilities that must pay the health care which commercial insurers do not cover.</description>

      <description>The ombudsman Anna Šabatova explained at the press conference that only those with a permanent residence can vote, but not those with a temporary but long-term stay. Their fundamental right is not ensured. The ombudsman has already alerted Minister of Interior to this and asked him to amend the relevant law. The ombudsman is convinced foreigners from EU countries with long-time residence permit in the Czech Republic could vote in this autumn&#39;s local elections already: &amp;quot;Primary European law can be applied directly in this case, that is before the legislative procedure of changing laws is completed,&amp;quot; Sabatova said and added that 160,000 foreigners from the EU countries are registered in the Czech Republic.</description>

      <description>Ombudsman Anna Sabatova have checked seven illegal social care institutes for the elderly suffering from dementia and found out that the care is unprofessional and bad and the conditions there undignified. Sabatova stressed that no one knew how many such institutes existed in the Czech Republic.
„The checks allow the only conclusion: all the institutes should be either legalised by being registered or should be closed“, said Sabatova and added that regional offices should supervise the process.</description>

      <description>Ombudsman was approached by a complainant requesting an inquiry into the procedure of the Ministry of Justice in supervising the activity of a court distrainor. She found the manner of distrainment out of proportion because the distrainor had “froze” eleven of the complainant&#39;s properties worth several million Czech korunas (and also three current accounts) for his failing to pay the maintenance and support of his son, slightly exceeding CZK 70,000.</description>

      <description>The Public Defender of Rights refused the possibility that the scope of his authority should be extended to include the monitoring of rights of persons with disabilities. Within his comments he pointed out to the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs that the Public Defender of Rights was not a &amp;quot;collecting&amp;quot; institution for the various agendas to which the Czech Republic has committed itself. The first Czech Ombudsman Otakar Motejl had repeatedly objected to such practice and criticised the attempt to incorporate the human rights agenda, including the field of discrimination, into the institution of the Public Defender of Rights, which is designed in a completely different way.</description>

      <description>Based on the findings of the Deputy-Ombudsman, the Ministry of Environment (hereinafter only “the Ministry”) erred by not applying the Administrative Procedure Code to the decision-making on subsidies from the Green Savings Programme (Zelená úsporám). Additionally, the State Environmental Fund dealt with the objections of rejected subsidy applicants in a manner violating law and contrary to the principles of good administration because it sent applicants only notifications of the Minister’s decision, without proper substantiation.</description>

In the given case, it cannot be stated without anything further that it is always possible to prescribe a medicinal product not subject to a co-payment because a particular medicinal product is not always suitable for a patient (due to its side effects or interactions with other medications).</description>

      <description>The complainant was a sixty-year old man, whom an employer had refused to employ as a driver, saying that the job was very physically demanding and unsuitable for elderly people. The complainant considered himself to be affected in his rights by the company’s behaviour. After inquiring into all circumstances, the Ombudsman found discrimination on grounds of age. With respect to the fact that the company in question did not respond to the Ombudsman&#39;s report with any attempt to remedy the situation, the Ombudsman recommended that the complainant seek the required apology and financial compensation in court.</description>

      <description>The Defender was approached by a head teacher of a kindergarten with a request for help. She stated that statutory representatives of one of the children not admitted had appealed a decision of non-admission with the Regional Authority of the South-Bohemian Region, which had found unlawfulness and reversed the decision of the head teacher, thereby admitting the appellant to preschool education. Following the decision of the appellate body the number of children in the kindergarten increased to twenty nine.</description>

In 2012 the Ombudsman observed, in certain countries (especially Vietnam, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan), difficulties pertaining to the operation of the VISAPOINT system, which requires foreign nationals in certain countries to register in order to be able to apply for a visa for stays in the Czech Republic longer than 90 days and for a long-term/permanent residence permit.</description>

He had no identity documents with him, but told the patrol that he lived just fifty metres away and that they could accompany him home where he could prove his identity.</description>

Under Slovak law, three Slovak care benefits for the severely disabled, namely the carer&amp;rsquo;s allowance (&amp;lsquo;peňažný príspevok na opatrovanie&amp;rsquo;), disability allowance (&amp;lsquo;peňažný príspevok na osobnú asistenciu&amp;rsquo;) and cash allowance for compensation of increased costs for severely disabled persons (&amp;lsquo;peňažný príspevok na kompenzáciu zvýšených výdavkov&amp;rsquo;) are provided only to those who live in Slovakia.</description>

      <description>(CTK) – Foreigners must not be expelled at Czech airports immediately, on the basis of the ombudsman&amp;rsquo;s opinion. The ombudsman criticised the order on immediate expulsion and therefore the foreigner police must not apply it any longer. A decision on expulsion must be always issued in regular administrative proceedings.The ombudsman primarily pointed out that foreigners cannot defend themselves against an immediate expulsion and were not sufficiently informed on the procedure.</description>

In the Czech Republic, the legislation still lacks on free legal aid, an agreement of this kind is an important moment in the battle against discrimination. Simultaneously, a suitable instrument for strategic litigation was created. Until the end of 2012, two cases were handed over to two law offices.</description>

These facts mean that people&#39;s legal awareness and the level of their resolve in seeking justice, even in the form of complaints, has been increasing.

      <description>In November 2011 the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs started the project “DONEZ“. The aim of this project is to eliminate illegal work. Employment applicants fulfilling certain criteria (for example repeated evidence at the labour office) have to present themselves 2-3x a week at the concrete outlet of the Czech Post (Czech Point) on a precisely determined day and time. More and more people address the Public defender of rights (ombudsman) with complaints in which they object that frequent commuting to so-called Czech Point limits their possibilities to look for a job in an active way.</description>

      <description>Ombudsman put forward substantial comments on the intended subject-matter since the law would represent a crucial change in the existing concept of the protection of public health against noise. This fact is admitted even by the sponsor of the bill. Since the Ministry of Health repeatedly referred in the bill to legal institutes used in “developed EU countries”, the ombudsman considered it suitable to note that there is a habit in “developed countries” to pre-discuss such a crucial change to legal regulation with both the expert and the non-expert public in order to achieve a broad social consensus and hear out those who may be affected by the change in the legal mode (e.</description>

      <description>The teachers of these schools themselves estimate that 35 % of their pupils are Romany children. If we compare these figures, it is relatively obvious that the proportion of Romany children placed in former special schools far exceeds their proportion of the population. According to the Anti-Discrimination Act, this constitutes indirect discrimination in access to education on the grounds of ethnicity by the bodies involved in deciding whether pupils should be placed into special education.</description>

      <description>Draft directive to specify the model, details and design of Social Systems Cards, the model, details and design of the Confirmation of the Loss, Theft, Damage or Destruction of a Social Systems Card, and the model of Standardised Social Worker Records is not in compliance with the constitutional order of the Czech Republic.
In the comments proceedings on this draft directive of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (hereafter simply “Ministry”) the ombudsman expressed a fundamental objection to the details of social systems cards (as public documents which in certain cases also serve as identity cards for the disabled) being specified in the implementing regulations.</description>

      <description>Brno, March 14 (CTK) &amp;ndash; The situation in the Czech judiciary threatens people&#39;s right to just court proceedings, since courts decide too slowly, mainly in civilian, guardianship, distraint and insolvency proceedings, Ombudsman Pavel Varvarovsky told journalists today.
The problem rests in an uneven filling of courts&#39; personnel capacities, rather than a shortage of judges, Varvarovsky said.
Unlike the number of judges, the number of court reporters, senior clerks and assistants is low, which has a negative impact, he said.</description>

      <description>Brno, March 14 (CTK) &amp;ndash; The chance of Czechs to defend themselves against the authority&#39;s decision not to grant them welfare benefits has declined under the new welfare system valid since January, Ombudsman Pavel Varvarovsky said today.
Previously, such people could turn to the nearest regional court. Now, however, the benefits are no longer granted by town halls but newly by labour offices, whose decisions can be appealed only with the City Court in Prague, Varvarovsky told journalists.</description>

      <description>On the basis of these cases, from 1 April 2011 the ombudsman began to continuously monitor the functionality of the Visapoint system.
It is essential that the Visapoint system works properly as the Czech embassies de facto reject applications for long-term or permanent residency if such applications are not filed through Visapoint. Although this requirement has no legal basis (a fact the ombudsman has drawn to the attention of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and has asked him to rectify the matter), it is crucial that until the matter is rectified, applicants are able to submit their applications.</description>

      <description>The employer who wants his religious employee to work on Saturday commits no discrimination, Czech ombudsman Pavel Varvarovsky said today, commenting on the case of two employees who had turned to him with their problem.
The two are members of the Seventh-Day Adventist church that considers Saturday the day of rest.
Their employer initially took an accommodating approach to them and did not order them to work on Saturdays. But this changed after the women switched to work positions in a continuous operation regime.</description>

      <description>His predecessor, the late Otakar Motejl, made two to three-times more recommendations every year, but deputies usually complied with few of them only.
Varvarovsky, who became ombudsman last September, said he reduced the number of proposals to those he considers of fundamental importance only.
He said the latest amendment to the employment law negates the sense and purpose of severance pay.
Under the amendment, a person who is entitled to a severance pay does not receive the unemployment benefit right after the loss of employment.</description>

      <description>The Defender believes that participation in decision-making concerning public matters at a local level is an important part of the integration process for foreigners. The exercising of this right can only intensify the foreigner’s feeling of belonging to his local environment, instil a feeling of trust, express the majority community’s acknowledgement of his contribution towards local society, and help the foreigner to become involved in local decision-making processes, including the assumption of co-responsibility.</description>

The police often unnecessarily take some personal items, such as watches and glasses, away from the detainees in police cells. Sometimes they even take the sheet of paper with the instructions about the detainees&#39; rights away from them for safety reasons, Varvarovsky said.</description>

He died at the age of 77 and his death is a great loss to society, a loss of one of the country&#39;s most respected personalities and public figures.</description>

      <description>In the Defender’s opinion, the draft strategy for the law suffers from a fundamental shortcoming, since the individual categories of children’s ombudspersons in Europe have not been studied sufficiently for making a political decision and choosing one of the available models. The Defender therefore proposed that the draft strategy be supplemented with a detailed analysis of the competences of children’s ombudspersons in European countries so that the Final Report evaluating the impact of regulation (Regulatory Impact Analysis, RIA) includes all available solutions.</description>

      <description>In 2006 to 2009, the Defender performed two key inquiries into selected model cases of failure to provide information on inspections and administrative offences of entrepreneurs. Both involved administrative bodies falling within the competence of the Ministry of Industry and Trade. It also followed from the inquiry that these cases were not unique, but rather systematic failure to provide this type of information. According to the Defender, there are no legal and substantive grounds for such an information embargo.</description>

      <description>A complainant addressed the Ministry of Justice on July 14, 2008, with an application for the provision of adequate satisfaction in connection with delays that had occurred in proceedings conducted at the Municipal Court in Brno. The Ministry responded with a letter dated July 31, 2008, in which it informed the complainant that it would request the files from the court in order to undertake the necessary inquiry and the complainant would be informed of the standpoint of the Ministry on her application.</description>

      <description>The deputy subsequently decided to order an expert standpoint aimed at assessing whether the conclusions of the expert reports were based on sufficient, exact underlying documents, whether the evaluations were based on the claimed content of the assessment and whether the interpretation of the expert reports indicated in the authorities’ decisions were fully in accordance with the conclusions and recommendations of the reports.
According to the conclusions of the expert standpoint drawn up by the Institute of Geological Sciences at the Faculty of Science of Masaryk University in Brno, the expert reports and reports on which the decisions of the bodies of mining administration were based had used erroneous primary data and erroneously determined groundwater levels.</description>

The Defender was addressed by the father of a friend of a minor who had been relocated from the children’s home to a reformatory.

      <description>The Decree generally stipulates the technical conditions of fire protection for the design, implementation and use of a building, stipulates the numbers of portable extinguishers, the obligation of the owners of selected buildings to furnish the building with the equipment for autonomous detection and signalling, with details contained in the annexes to the Decree. However, the overwhelming majority of the annexes refer to Czech technical standards that are not commonly available to the public, and more importantly, are not available free of charge.</description>

      <description>Authentication of signatures outside the office of an authorityA complainant’s husband was placed in the After-treatment and Rehabilitation Facility of the St. Anne’s University Hospital in Brno-Nový Lískovec and needed authentication of his signature. The Brno-Lískovec municipal office refused to carry out authentication of the signature outside its office and referred the applicant to the registry office (the Brno-centre municipal office), but the latter also refused to perform the authentication. The deputy of the Defender opened an inquiry on the basis of the complaint.</description>

      <guid>https://ochrance-preview.netlify.app/en/aktualne/complaint-concerned-with-the-i-muslim-programme/</guid>
      <description>It was ascertained through inquiry that the Council had discontinued the proceedings on administrative infringement without substantiating its procedure in its decision in any manner whatsoever and without incorporating the reasons at least in the administrative file. The procedure of the Council was therefore assessed as non-transparent and exhibiting the characteristics of arbitrary behaviour of an administrative body.
The Council changed its existing practice on the basis of the inquiry and will properly substantiate decisions also in cases where the proceedings are discontinued.</description>

      <description>After analysing the case, the Defender concluded that the Office had been substantively competent to assess the acts of the National Library as the contracting authority within the design competition and to make a decision regarding their legality. At least in cases where a design competition clearly aims towards actual awarding of a public contract, as was the case with the National Library, the Office must take measures to prevent unlawful conduct.</description>

      <description>The ASLPC had not contacted the wider family in order to ascertain the possibility of entrusting the children to the care of family members even after the issue of the preliminary injunctions, in spite of the fact that the ASLPC should do so on its own initiative. The ASLPC personnel had begun to act only after they were repeatedly requested to do so by the children’s grandfather and uncle (they advised the grandfather of the possibility to lodge a proposal for entrusting the children to his care only during his second visit to the ASLPC).</description>

      <description>The deputy of the Defender initiated an inquiry in the matter concentrating on the procedure of the Regional Health Authority and found the latter passive (the Health Authority should have actively entered into negotiations with the operator as it had had trustworthy information already in 2008 that the deadline for completion of the noise barriers would not be met). If it intended to act favourably towards the operator, it should have at least commenced informal communication with it to seek a solution to the situation.</description>

      <description>The deputy released a report on the inquiry after receipt of the statements of both authorities. The report states that it is obvious from the provided materials that the ties are hazardous waste and she requests the Czech Environmental Inspectorate to perform an inspection of the handling of the waste at the originator of the waste (Railway Infrastructure Administration, state organisation). She simultaneously requested the Chief Public Health Officer that he publish a notice on the hazardous characteristics of the ties.</description>

The Minister of Culture informed the Defender that in order to avoid future conflicts in the assessment of planned building projects in the Barrandov area, Prague City Hall would instigate the issuing of a Protection Plan for the aforementioned protected cultural zone in the sense of Section 6a of Act No.</description>

      <description>As opposed to the trade licensing office, the deputy opined that although the complainant’s activity involved some elements of a trade, unlawful business activity was not the case, primarily given the specific manner of caring for the files resulting from the obligations in the area of archiving. As a result of the aforementioned obligations (given the periods applicable to the destruction of documents), agreements on the custody of documents must be concluded for long periods of time.</description>

Within the inquiry, a working meeting took place in the Office of the Public Defender of Rights in September 2007 with participation of representatives of the Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry for Regional Development, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Chief Health Officer.</description>

      <description>Removal of children for housing reasons The Defender found serious maladministration in the procedure of the body of social and legal protection of children (ASLPC), both in connection with filing a motion for ordering a preliminary injunction and in deciding on the awarding of children to pre-foster care. The Defender’s opinion is that in a situation where the mother had advised the ASLPC of her decision to deal with her adverse housing situation by moving to her parents, the motion for preliminary injunction removing the child from the mother should no longer have been filed.</description>

      <description>The regional authority and the Ministry of Transport did not agree with the Defender; they promote the certificate of existence of a road pursuant to Part IV of the Code of Administrative Procedure. The Defender therefore now requires that the Ministry of Transport performs its own analysis of the possibilities available to the highway administration authorities, which should determine as to what procedure the authorities should take in settling disputes about the existence and extent of use of a purpose-built road.</description>

      <description>The deputy found the Area Inspectorate responsible for failing to sufficiently exercise its powers in the inspection (asking employees questions, co-operating with the labour office) and stated that the inspection showed a significant defect in failing to ascertain that the husband had not had an employment contract.

      <description>The Defender holds the view that the export of socially excluded families or families threatened with social exclusion from municipalities and towns where they have lived for a long time cannot be accepted as a conceptual and effective solution. Co-operation between the bodies of aid in material need, the social and legal protection of children, field social workers, non-governmental organisations, Romani families and the self-governing bodies of the town is the key to dealing with social exclusion.</description>

      <description>Our aim is to systematically improve the lives of people with disabilities. We work with them directly, visit regularly the facilities where they live and conduct relevant research and surveys. We would appreciate if you let us know about any problems that people with disabilities have to face so that we can look into them. For example, issues such as that it is impossible for wheelchair users to get on a train, that there are not enough sign language interpreters or there is a lack of some other services that could help people with disabilities live more independent lives.</description>

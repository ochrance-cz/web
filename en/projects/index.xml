      <description>Pursuant to Act No. 349/1999 Coll., on the Public Defender of Rights, as amended, the Public Defender of Rights (hereinafter the “Defender”) has, from the very beginning of the institution, protected individuals against acts of selected public authorities and institutions in order to carry out his or her explicit statutory role of contributing to the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. The Defender is active not only within the framework of maintaining basic lawfulness; in addition to protecting the principles of good governance, the Defender also monitors the observance of rule of law to the extent in which it is inseparably linked with the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms in modern democratic countries.</description>

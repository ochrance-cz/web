examples:
  - name: Mr. Petr
    desc: I care for my elderly mother who is seriously ill and requires full-time
      assistance during the day. The authority granted her the lowest allowance
      for care and we simply could not afford to hire any help for that little
      money. So I approached the Ombudsman who later found out that the
      authority had not proceeded correctly and ensured that the allowance was
      increased and that they paid my mother the owed amount.
  - name: Ms. Martina
    desc: After a reconstruction of a pavement in our town, water started leaking
      into our garage. Our dealings with the town hall got us nowhere so I
      approached the Ombudsman who helped us resolve the situation quickly.
      Eventually, the municipality built gutters that take the water away from
      our property.
  - name: Ms. Františka
    desc: Thanks to the Ombudsman, I finally get the correct amount of disability
      pension. Before his intervention, I was getting significantly less money,
      just because the authorities did not take into consideration my serious
      long-term illness.
  - name: Mr. Lukáš
    desc: When I was deeply in debt and with bailiffs knocking on my door, I turned
      to the Ombudsman for help. Although it was not in his competence to
      inquire into my problems, he still gave me valuable advice on how to
      proceed and who to talk to.
whenToContact:
  - Ombudsman nemůže jednat za vás – napřed se musíte sami snažit problém řešit.
  - Nejprve se musíte sami na úřad obrátit a počkat na rozhodnutí.
  - Když s rozhodnutím nesouhlasíte, odvolejte se. Většinou to jde. Pohlídejte
    si přitom lhůty – později už náprava nemusí být možná.
  - Když je úřad nečinný, stěžujte si k jeho nadřízenému úřadu, aby zajistil
    nápravu.
  - Když se svou snahou problém řešit neuspějete, je čas obrátit se na
    ombudsmana.

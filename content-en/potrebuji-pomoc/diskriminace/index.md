title: I think I am being discriminated against
perex: The Anti-Discrimination Act stipulates specific areas in which unequal
  treatment is prohibited on grounds listed by the Act.
hp: Do you believe that someone is treating you differently because of your age,
  sex, nationality or on some other grounds specified by the Anti-Discrimination
  Act? Is it an authority, a company or local self-government that discriminate
  against you?

  - The Ombudsman can only deal with cases that involve discrimination specified
    in the Anti-Discrimination Act. Unfortunately, that does not mean that
    discrimination does not occur in other areas of life and on other grounds,
    such as language, social background, membership in political parties and
    movements, marital and family status or obligations towards a family. Other
    cases of discrimination also include harassment, provoking hostile
    environment, sexual harassment or victimisation of a person defending
    himself/herself against discrimination. Such conduct is, however, prohibited
    under laws other than the Anti-Discrimination Act.
  - If you find yourself in one of these situations, we can still advise you on
    what to do and how to find a solution.
examples:
  - desc: I asked my employer for shorter working hours so that I could both earn
      money and also have time to take care of my children. Even though the
      situation at work allowed it, my superior refused to change the contract.
      I approached the Ombudsman who reviewed my case and found out that it
      involved discrimination. Thanks to his intervention, my employer
      recognised my right to a part-time job and we reached an agreement

  - desc: The city refused to rent us a flat because we are a Roma family. I thought
      it was unfair – we are regular tenants, we work and have no debts. So I
      submitted a complaint to the Ombudsman. With his help, we managed to rent
      the flat and the city learned that the Roma people should not be treated
      differently.
    name: Ms. Věra
  - desc: I am 71 years old. I am retired, but still active and I run a successful
      business. My wife and I were preparing our vacation abroad thinking we
      could rent a car and travel. The car rental requires a credit card as a
      guarantee, but our local bank refused to issue one for me because I am
      over 70 years old. I approached the Ombudsman who pointed out to the bank
      that their conduct was discriminatory. As a result, they changed their
      position and now issue credit cards to all elderly clients.

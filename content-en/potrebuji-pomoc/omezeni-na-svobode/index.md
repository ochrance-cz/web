title: People restricted in their freedom are treated badly
perex: They treat you, or someone close to you, badly in a retirement home,
  treatment facility for long-term patients, psychiatric hospital, children’s
  home, prison, or some other facility, and you think that the Ombudsman should
  make an inspection.
hp: They treat you, or someone close to you, badly in a retirement home,
  treatment facility for long-term patients, psychiatric hospital, children’s
  home, prison, or some other facility, and you think that the Ombudsman should

we-can:
  - If you, or someone who is close to you, face ill-treatment in one of these
    facilities.
  - We can talk with the facility or its founder about improving the conditions
    and preventing ill-treatment.
we-cannot:
  - We are not able to inspect every single facility, so if you, or someone who
    is close to you, face ill-treatment in a facility where people’s freedom is
    restricted, do not hesitate to submit a complaint. Even if we cannot deal
    with your case, we can at least give you advice on how to find a solution..
examples:
  - name: Mr. Oldřich
    desc: I live in a retirement home and I was bothered by the obligation to wear
      pyjamas all day long. I complained about that when a lawyer from the
      Ombudsman’s office visited us for an inspection. This helped and we can
      all now wear our usual everyday clothes.
  - name: Ms. Monika
    desc: The director of our children’s home was reluctant to give me permits to
      visit my mum at home on the weekends. I wrote about this to the Ombudsman
      who looked into it and, as a result, the director changed his mind and
      gave me the permit.
  - name: Ms. Veronika
    desc: In prison, we were at first allowed to take warm showers only once a week.
      The Ombudsman was dealing with our case, then the decree was changed and
      we can now shower twice a week.

We inspect facilities where people are restricted in their freedom, including:

* Retirement homes
* Homes for people with disabilities

* Facilities for detention of foreigners and others

We perform the inspections without prior notice so as to witness the actual conditions there.

    If arriving in Brno by coach or train, to get to the Office of the Public
    Defender of Rights it is easiest to take tram No. 4 from the Main Railway
    Station (the stop is located about 10 minutes walk from the Central Coach
    Station).


    Take the tram heading in the direction of Masarykova čtvrt. Get off at Obilní trh (it takes about 10 minutes to get there). Follow the tram tracks and after 50 metres turn left to see the Office of the Public Defender of Rights.

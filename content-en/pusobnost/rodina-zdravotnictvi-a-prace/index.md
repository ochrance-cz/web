## **Family**

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

In most cases, people seek help with problems in the area of family life, especially when they are dissatisfied with the procedure taken by a body for social and legal protection of children (BSLPC). This includes situations where a parent prevents the other parent from contacting their child, where there is a risk of removal of a child from the family or where the guardian ad litem does not protect the child’s interest in court proceedings. Apart from the above, we also deal with issues such as substitute family care and complaints concerning conditions in facilities for children.

## Work and employment

We inquire into the procedure of the Labour Office. Specifically, we deal with complaints against decisions on matters such as unemployment benefits, the penalty of removal from the register of jobseekers, and re-training. However, we also inquire into the activities of labour inspectorates, for instance in relation to insufficient inspection of the employer, etc.

      **Parking**


      There is a parking lot next to the Office building with reserved parking spaces for people with disabilities. These are located right next to the barrier-free entrance into the building. To enter the parking lot, our reception staff must open the gate for you. Ring the bell at the entrance to the parking lot and state the reason for your visit. The reception staff will then let you in.


      If you cannot reach the bell, call the reception desk at 542 542 111. The reception staff will open the barrier for you.

      **Parking**


      There is a parking lot next to the Office building with reserved parking spaces for people with disabilities. These are located right next to the barrier-free entrance into the building. To enter the parking lot, our reception staff must open the gate for you. Ring the bell at the entrance to the parking lot and state the reason for your visit. The reception staff will then let you in.


      If you cannot reach the bell, call the reception desk at 542 542 111. The reception staff will open the barrier for you.


      **Main entrance of the building**


      There are steps leading to the main entrance of the building. An acoustic signalling device is installed above the door. The reception desk faces the main entrance. To the left, there is the filing department and offices for personal deliveries of complaints. Entrance to the Otakar Motejl Hall and the Small Hall, where majority of our public events is held (lectures, seminars, trainings), is to the right of the reception desk.


      **Barrier-free entrance**


      The barrier-free entrance into the building is located at the parking lot in front of the building. You need to ring the bell of the RECEPTION DESK and the reception staff will open the door for you. The public areas of the Offices (reception desk, filing department, offices for personal deliveries of complaints, halls and press centre) are accessible by stairs or an elevator. If you need any assistance (e.g. opening the entrance door), ask the reception staff when you ring. They will be happy to help you.


      **Reception**


      One employee is present at the reception desk throughout the day and can help you, give you directions or accompany you to the place you are looking for. A portable hearing induction loop is available at the reception desk. Feel free to use it, for example, at the office for personal deliveries.


      **Filing department**


      If you come to submit a complaint in person, you can hand it over to the employees at the filing department on business days from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. They will accept the complaint and pass it on for further processing.


      **Halls and press centre**


      All of the premises of the Office are barrier-free. A hearing induction loop is available in the halls and the press centre. These areas are also equipped with a video streaming technology.

perex: <p>As of today, children can officially turn to the Children's Ombudsman
  for help. Until the Chamber of Deputies elects him, Deputy Ombudsman Vít
  Alexander Schorm will carry out his responsibilities. He will have a team of
  lawyers at his disposal. From 1 July, a new independent national human rights
  institution (NHRI) will assume the role of human rights watchdog in the Czech
  Republic, entrusting this responsibility to the Ombudsman. Its main task will
  be to evaluate the activities of the state from a human rights perspective.
  The Czech Republic will thus join other European countries that already have
  both bodies. The Children's Ombudsman and the NHRI will be based in the
  current ombudsman's Office at Údolní 39 in Brno. Its name will also change to
  the Office of the Public Defender of Rights and Defender of Children's
  Rights.</p>

<p>Following the establishment of the Children's Ombudsman, it is expected that the number of complaints from children themselves will increase. Both children and adults can submit complaints in matters that directly affect children's rights, such as social and legal protection. Another important task will be to conduct educational activities and monitor the fulfilment of children's rights. In some cases, the Children's Ombudsman will be able to intervene directly in court proceedings or initiate them. “This week is significant for children for two reasons. Not only have their holidays begun, but the Children's Ombudsman has also officially been established, and children can turn to us at any time. All they have to do is come to us, write to us or call us. Children can be sure that someone will listen to them and that we will respond to every issue they raise. In each case, we will act in the best interests of the child," said Vít Alexander Schorm, Deputy Children's Ombudsman.</p>
<p>The Children's Ombudsman may request the cooperation of state authorities, social services, schools, educational institutions, prisons and facilities for children requiring immediate assistance, among others.</p>
<p>From 1 July 2025, the Ombudsman will also become a National Human Rights Institution (NHRI). This is effectively an expansion of his human rights responsibilities. It should monitor the human rights situation in the Czech Republic independently and impartially, alerting the public and legislators to potential issues and propose systemic solutions and recommendations. Through expert opinions, it will thus help the state to promote human rights. “By establishing a national human rights institution, we will join the ranks of other European countries that already have one. Czech society has thus gained significant support in the area of human rights protection. We have already addressed a number of human rights issues within the existing scope of the Ombudsman's powers. The law now further expands the range of issues on which we will be able to comment. We will be able to draw on all our experience and knowledge to date," said the Ombudsman Stanislav Křeček.</p>

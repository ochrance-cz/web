perex: <p>The government has submitted an amendment to the Building Act to the
  Chamber of Deputies without first conducting a public consultation process.
  The Ombudsman disagrees with this approach. He warns that the amendment
  provides insufficient protection for public interests such as the protection
  of health, the environment, and cultural heritage. He also points to a
  weakening of the rights of citizens and other participants in building permit
  proceedings.</p>

<i>“I consider it inappropriate for such an extensive and serious change to the legal framework to be pushed through hastily and without proper expert discussion,”</i> said Ombudsman Stanislav Křeček regarding the amendment to the Building Act.
<br>The amendment was approved by the Government of the Czech Republic on 16 December without assessment by experts, ministries, regional authorities, or professional chambers through the standard interministerial consultation procedure. The bill is now at the stage of parliamentary deliberation in the Chamber of Deputies.</p>
<h4>Speed Prioritised Over Health, Environment and Heritage</h4>
<p>
<i>“Speed and efficiency in construction are being prioritised at the expense of other public interests—such as the protection of health, the environment, cultural heritage, or the quality of housing. I find it unacceptable that such fundamental changes are being prepared in haste and without sufficient expert debate,”</i> the Ombudsman explained.</p>
<p>For this reason, Stanislav Křeček has decided to address specific comments to members of three parliamentary committees—the Economic Affairs Committee, the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee, and the Committee on Public Administration and Regional Development. He is asking MPs to take his objections into account during the consideration of the amendment.</p>
<h4>Weaker Rules on Illegal Construction and Noise</h4>
<p>The Ombudsman points to changes that would sideline certain aspects of the public interest. For example, the amendment would allow construction permits to be issued even in areas where development would previously have been impermissible—such as the installation of photovoltaic panels in heritage protection zones or the approval of a shopping centre in locations not permitted by zoning plans. Measures against illegal construction would be weakened. Rules for assessing noise impacts would become unclear and overly permissive. Requirements for accessibility for persons with disabilities would be reduced.</p>
<p>
<br>Stanislav Křeček also stresses the need to examine the human rights implications of the proposal:
<i> “The proposed wording of the amendment weakens the right to challenge decisions made by administrative authorities. I find it particularly alarming that the amendment does not allow administrative remedies against decisions on the largest construction projects, such as motorways, railways, or large residential developments. For participants in proceedings, only one option would remain—the filing of an administrative lawsuit.”</i></p>
<p>
<br>The proposal envisages the amendment to the Building Act taking effect as early as 1 July 2026.

<p>In their joint statement, the ombudsmen point out that the countries of the Visegrad Four are and most probably will be among the countries that will receive huge numbers of refugees from Ukraine. <em>&bdquo;</em><em>As Ombudspersons of these states, we believe that it is both our legal and moral duty to provide effective and timely support and assistance to Ukrainian citizens and all people fleeing war-torn Ukraine on our territories, with special attention to the most vulnerable groups of people like children, older person, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, etc.&quot;</em> the statement says.</p>

<p>According to the Czech Ombudsman Stanislav Křeček, the unified position and approach of the Visegrad Four countries is particularly important at the moment: <em>&bdquo;I see this joint declaration of the ombudsmen as a contribution to strengthening cooperation between the V4 countries, which was also mentioned, for example, by Prime Minister Petr Fiala after the meeting of the prime ministers of the Visegrad Four countries last week. It is our countries that are the first to be targeted by people affected by the war in Ukraine. And we must help them in their difficult situation,&quot;</em> the Czech Ombudsman said.</p>

<p>The V4 Ombudsmen also condemned all Russian military actions against civilians and civilian objects or in any other way constituting a breach of international humanitarian law. They therefore welcome the preliminary ruling of the European Court of Human Rights requesting the Government of Russia to&nbsp;refrain from military attacks against civilians and civilian objects, including residential premises, emergency vehicles and other specially protected civilian objects such as schools and hospitals, and to ensure immediately the safety of the medical establishments, personnel and emergency vehicles within the territory under attack or siege by Russian troops.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;We sincerely wish and hope that the armed conflict will be brought to an end as soon as possible through diplomatic efforts and without further unnecessary bloodshed,&rdquo;</em> agreed the representatives of the ombudsman institutions of the Visegrad Four countries.</p>

<p>The legal action to protect public interest against the decision of the Olomouc Municipality concerning the placement of the Šantovka Tower was filed by the former Ombudswoman Anna Šabatová. Several laws were violated according the action: The Act on the State Heritage Protection, the Act on Nature and Landscape Protection, the Administrative Code, the Construction Act, as well as the Czech Republic's obligations under the Convention on the Protection of the Architectural Heritage of Europe.</p> <p>In the reasoning of the decision, the Court notes that the suspensory effect was granted in order to prevent any irreversible actions, since the mere subsequent annulment of the decision on the placement of the construction work may not have any actual impact.</p> <p><a title="Opening in a new window" href="https://www.ochrance.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/VOP/Tiskove_zpravy_prilohy/Santovka-odkladny-ucinek.pdf" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://www.ochrance.cz/typo3/ext/od_linkdesc/icons/pdf.gif" class="od_linkdesc_icon" /> The ruling on the suspensive effect (in the Czech language)</a> (3 MB, Adobe Acrobat document)</p> <p><a href="https://eso.ochrance.cz/Nalezene/Edit/7814" target="_blank">The full text of the legal action (in the Czech language)</a></p>

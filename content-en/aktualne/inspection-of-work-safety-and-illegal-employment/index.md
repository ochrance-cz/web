The Area Inspectorate had performed an inspection on the basis of a complaint from a complainant whose husband had worked for a company without any contract and suffered an occupational injury. However, the Area Inspectorate had failed to ascertain that the husband of the complainant had not been employed with the company concerned at all and found just minor maladministration in the area of work safety.</p>'

<p class="Normln-web">The deputy found the Area Inspectorate responsible for failing to sufficiently exercise its powers in the inspection (asking employees questions, co-operating with the labour office) and stated that the inspection showed a significant defect in failing to ascertain that the husband had not had an employment contract.</p>
<p class="Normln-web">An interim report on the inquiry was issued in the matter and the deputy awaits the response of the Area Inspectorate to her findings.</p>

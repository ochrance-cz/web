perex: <p>How do Czech authorities respond when a foreign national contacts them
  in a language other than the official ones (Czech or Slovak)? This was the
  subject of a new study by the Ombudsman. The findings show that authorities do
  not handle electronic submissions in foreign languages consistently. The
  complexity of the submission and the language skills of officials play a role.
  The Ministry of the Interior has called on public authorities to follow the
  recommendations arising from the Ombudsman’s research.</p>

<i>“Officials must not ignore a submission simply because it is not in the official language. They may only request a certified translation from a foreign language for submissions that initiate administrative proceedings,”</i> explained Ombudsman Stanislav Křeček.</p>
<p>In his research, he focused only on electronic submissions that do not initiate proceedings. Therefore, foreigners are not required to provide a certified translation in such cases.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman collected data through a questionnaire sent to ministries, other central administrative authorities (such as the Czech Telecommunication Office and the Energy Regulatory Office), selected supervisory bodies (for example, the Czech Trade Inspection Authority, the Czech School Inspectorate, and the General Financial Directorate), as well as regional authorities, municipal authorities, and municipal offices with extended powers.</p>
<p>What did the findings reveal?</p>
<h4>Similar Experience, Different Procedures: Authorities Lack an Unified Approach</h4>
<p>Ninety percent of the authorities contacted by the Ombudsman took part in the survey. However, a total of 336 responses were received from 262 authorities—some institutions provided more than one response because procedures for receiving and processing foreign-language submissions are not uniform across their internal departments.
<br>
<br>
<i>“It is unacceptable for different departments within the same authority to follow different procedures. Based on the survey results, we have formulated several recommendations. Most authorities have promised to follow them,”</i> said the Ombudsman, adding that he is prepared to monitor compliance with these commitments in the future. The Ministry of the Interior also presented the Ombudsman’s proposals at a regular coordination meeting, calling on authorities to adhere to them.
<br>
<br>This issue is important because submissions in foreign languages are not rare. They are most frequently encountered by supervisory bodies and other central government authorities (71%) and least frequently (54%) by municipal authorities with extended powers (excluding city councils).</p>
<h4>Official or Translator: Who Will Answer Me—and How?</h4>
<p>English, German, Polish, Ukrainian, but also Italian, French, and even Hungarian in some areas—officials encounter all of these languages. Some civil servants are able to translate such submissions themselves and respond in the same language. Officials at ministries, central administrative authorities, and supervisory bodies are generally better equipped linguistically than employees of regional authorities, municipal offices, and municipalities with extended powers.</p>
<p>
<i>“The good news is that authorities require translations into the official language only in a minority of cases where they are not actually necessary. This happens least often at ministries and most often at regional and municipal authorities, where translations are required for roughly 40% of foreign-language submissions,”</i> said the Ombudsman. Ministry officials also respond in Czech less often (27%), while officials at regional and municipal authorities use Czech most frequently in their replies (62%).</p>
<h4>Foreign-Language Information on Websites</h4>
<p>The survey also looked at whether authorities provide foreign-language information on their websites. It found that regional authorities and city councils most often offer foreign-language versions (88%), followed by ministries (60%), and municipal authorities with extended powers (52%).</p>
<p>Authorities often rely on automatic translation tools for their websites, and officials are increasingly using them as well when handling simple foreign-language submissions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>What Does the Ombudsman Recommend to Authorities?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Authorities must not ignore submissions solely because they are not written in the official language.</li>
<li>They may request a certified translation only if the submission initiates administrative proceedings.</li>
<li>For other types of submissions, authorities may request a translation only when their staff lack the necessary language skills and cannot use available online translation tools.</li>
<li>Any request for translation must be addressed directly to the sender, preferably in the language of the original submission.</li>
<li>Authorities should strive to ensure that their staff are sufficiently linguistically equipped—with English as the minimum standard.</li>
<li>Authorities should adopt unified internal rules for handling foreign-language submissions.</li></ul></blockquote>

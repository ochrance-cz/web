<p class="Normln" style="text-indent:0pt;">It was ascertained through inquiry that the Council had discontinued the proceedings on administrative infringement without substantiating its procedure in its decision in any manner whatsoever and without incorporating the reasons at least in the administrative file. The procedure of the Council was therefore assessed as non-transparent and exhibiting the characteristics of arbitrary behaviour of an administrative body.</p>
<p class="Normln" style="text-indent:0pt;">The Council changed its existing practice on the basis of the inquiry and will properly substantiate decisions also in cases where the proceedings are discontinued. In addition, access of the public to information on the work of the Council should soon be made easier and broader by means of a website.</p>

  <p>On 2 August, we commemorate the last 4,300 Roma and Sinti in the German
  Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau, who were murdered by the SS on
  that night in 1944 despite their fierce resistance. In memory of all 500,000
  Roma and Sinti murdered in Nazi-occupied Europe, the European Parliament
  declared this date the European Holocaust Memorial Day for Roma and Sinti in
  2015. On August 2, 2024, we will commemorate the 80th anniversary with the
  last survivors of the Holocaust of Roma and Sinti.</p>

<p>The significant anniversary will grant to the genocide of Roma and Sinti the much-needed visibility and recognition at the European level. Historical memory always implies lived responsibility for the present. Today, 80 years after the end of the war, when we recall the Nazi crimes and the Holocaust, we must simultaneously work for the rule of law and a vivid democracy in the present day.&nbsp; The world&#39;s states are called upon to live up to the legacy of Auschwitz and to take decisive action against these developments.</p>

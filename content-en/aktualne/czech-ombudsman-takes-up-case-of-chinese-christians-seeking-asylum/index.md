<p>Examination of the cases appear to be taking a very long time (some of the cases date back around two years) and the watchdog says in media it has so far received no replies so far to its request for explanations from the Ministry of Interior.</p><p> Ombudsman Anna Šabatová took up the case on her own initiation: <i>&quot;We informed the Ministry of Interior officially that we have launched administrative procedures and lodged five questions with them seeking answers. And we sought deadlines when we can look at the documents. Until those deadlines expire nothing will happen. It would not be exceptional if the ministry does not reply in time. Unfortunately this section for asylum and migration policy often cooperates in a very unenthusiastic fashion and I think that could also be the subject of procedural steps as well.&quot;</i></p>

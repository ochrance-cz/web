<p>This research is the first of its kind to examine how the rights of persons with disabilities are implemented in practice, using human-rights indicators. These indicators provide an understanding of the real-life situation of people with disabilities – not just what the law provides, but what the State actually does and the practical impact of its actions.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>What Is a Human Rights Indicator?</strong></p>
<p>A human rights indicator is a specific piece of data or information that shows how human rights are respected in practice. For example, it can reveal whether effective laws protect people with disabilities from violence, how many public offices are accessible and how many people with disabilities live outside institutions such as psychiatric hospitals. Indicators make it possible to track successes over time as well as identify areas where the protection of individual and group rights needs to be strengthened.</p></blockquote>
<p>In his latest research, the Deputy Defender focused on four areas: non-discrimination, equal recognition before the law, independent living, and work and employment. The findings show the strongest performance in non-discrimination (49%) and the weakest in equal recognition before the law (28%), which includes restrictions on legal capacity. Overall, with only 38% of obligations met, people with disabilities in the Czech Republic still lack the same opportunities as others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<i>“Like in some other countries, there is a perception in the Czech Republic that social benefits, special schools, and institutions provide people with disabilities with sufficient support, and that they are not disadvantaged. Our findings, however, show that this view overlooks the real challenges. The Convention we have committed to implementing rejects systems that separate people with disabilities from the community, limits their potential, and makes decisions for them. Many of them want to live differently 
<strong>–&nbsp;</strong>independently and with equal opportunities</i>,” says Deputy Defender Vít Alexander Schorm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Where the State Falls Short of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities?</strong></p>
<p>For example, the State:</p>
<ul>
<li>does not protect people with disabilities from all forms of discrimination they experience in daily life;</li>
<li>does not ensure a gradual reduction in the number of people with restricted legal capacity, whose decisions are made by guardians;</li>
<li>does not actively support more people with disabilities to leave large institutions and live in the community with appropriate services;</li>
<li>does not sufficiently encourage mainstream employers to offer job opportunities to people with disabilities, resulting in a disproportionately high number working only in sheltered employment;</li>
<li>does not systematically collect information on the personal experiences of people with disabilities regarding discrimination, nor gather the data needed to assess the impact of laws and other measures on their lives and those of their families.</li></ul></blockquote>
<p>
<i>“The research shows that without a clear plan, adequate support services, and trust in the abilities of people with disabilities, progress will remain limited. In our report, we offer recommendations that can contribute to real change – so that people with disabilities can live more independently, with dignity, and according to their own choices,”</i> says Romana Jakešová, Head of the Department for Protection of Rights of Persons with Disabilities at the Office of the Public Defender of Rights and Defender of Children’s Rights. She notes that the Defender’s advisory body, composed of people with disabilities and advocacy organisations, was also involved in the research activities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the report, the Deputy Defender recommends, among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing a more effective government strategy on the rights of persons with disabilities for 2026–2030;</li>
<li>supporting independent decision-making for people with disabilities instead of restricting their legal capacity;</li>
<li>ensuring accessible social services in the communities where people want to live;</li>
<li>promoting the employment of people with disabilities in the open labour market;</li>
<li>collecting reliable data and periodically reviewing the impact of laws and policies.</li></ul></blockquote>
<p>The Deputy Defender’s findings are intended to open a dialogue, especially with the State institutions responsible for upholding the rights of people with disabilities. The report will also inform the Deputy Defender’s discussions with the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Geneva. Disability advocacy organisations and the academic community can likewise use the research as a resource.</p>

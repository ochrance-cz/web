  <p>Unilateral aggression against a sovereign state is in direct contradiction
  to the norms and social ethics of the 21st century. Protecting the rights and
  lives of people, as well as the future of the nation targeted by this extreme
  act, is a major challenge for the entire international community. Our
  sympathies are with all those directly affected by today&#39;s events and we
  deplore the unnecessary loss of life on both sides of the conflict. We stand
  with those who defend human rights anywhere in the world.</p>

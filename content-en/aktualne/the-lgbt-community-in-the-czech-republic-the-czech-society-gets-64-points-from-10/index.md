<p>In autumn 2018, the Czech Ombudswoman together with the Prague Pride Association conducted one of the largest surveys among lesbians, gays, bisexuals and trans people in the Czech Republic. The research’s outcomes were presented on the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia on 17 May 2019 and the results were also made available on the Ombudsman’s website. </p> <p>As to the main findings of the survey, it found out that almost ¾ of the LGBT+ people in the Czech Republic believe that the members of their community are discriminated. In the last five years more than one third of the LGBT+ people felt to become victims of discrimination themselves. Moreover, LGBT+ people often face many kinds of prejudices from the side of the general public. Still, the members of the LGBT+ community in the Czech Republic assess their position in the Czech society rather positively – 6,4 points from 10. </p> <p>What would improve the position of the LGBT+ people in the Czech Republic? There are four absolute “winners” which the LGBT+ people consider to be vital for the improvement of their position in the society: equal marriage, prevention of homophobic and transphobic bullying at schools, stronger support to LGBT by politicians, and diversity strategies at workplace. </p> <p>More information about the outcomes of the research can be found on the website of Prague Pride and on the Czech Ombudsman’s website:</p> <p><b><a href="/uploads-import/DISKRIMINACE/Vyzkum/LGBT_Factsheet_EN.pdf" target="_blank">Being LGBT+ in the Czech Republic (research)</a></b></p> <a href="https://www.praguepride.cz/en/news/447-ombudsmans-research-lgbt-citizens-experience-discrimination-3times-more-than-the-general-population" target="_blank">https://www.praguepride.cz/en/news/447-ombudsmans-research-lgbt-citizens-experience-discrimination-3times-more-than-the-general-population</a>

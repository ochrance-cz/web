<p>First of all, the Ombudsman objected that the actions taken by the Ministry – giving only 5 working days to the stakeholders to submit their legislative comments to the Act when significant changes were made in the proposal – contradicts the Legislative Rules of the Government. In the end, this approach makes the inter-departmental review inapplicable in its full extend and it forces the stakeholders to keep their comments at the minimum. This procedure is inacceptable, especially when the legislative proposal concerns the recodification of such an important act which has considerable consequences on the whole society. </p> <p>Several institutions having the right to submit legislative comments on this legislative proposal joined the Ombudsman’s open letter and drew the attention to the recodification of the Building Act in this way. As the Ombudsman stated in his letter, the preparation of such a crucial legislative act cannot be approached trough trial-and-error and expressed his hope that the Government will share his view and will approach this issue with responsibility and professionalism.</p> <p> </p> <p><a title="Opening in a new window" href="/uploads-import/VOP/Tiskove_zpravy_prilohy/Predsedovi-vlady_stavebni-zakon.pdf" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://www.ochrance.cz/typo3/ext/od_linkdesc/icons/pdf.gif" class="od_linkdesc_icon" /> Letter to the Prime Minister in the Czech language listing the institutions that joined the Ombudsman's initiative</a> (239.1 kB, Adobe Acrobat document)</p>

<p>The meeting offered the opportunity to explain not only the general contours of the functioning and tasks of the Ombudsman in the Czech Republic but also the specific new agenda (from 1 January 2018) concerning the protection of the rights of EU citizens. The presentation was led by the Ombudswoman, Anna Šabatová, and two of her colleagues, Iva Fellerová Palkovská who is the EU citizens’ rights specialist and Tereza Domanská, the specialist in the field of the asylum and migration law. The discussions during the meeting showed high interest of the ambassadors resulting into a vivid and mutually enriching conversation. The Ambassadors were pleased to be informed about the new competence of the Ombudsman; they also shared with the Ombudswoman the difficulties their citizens face in the Czech Republic most often according to their practical experience. This was an excellent opportunity for the Ombudswoman and her colleagues to gather important topics for their future work in this agenda.</p><p><img src="/uploads-import/uploads/RTEmagicC_IMG_0087-web.jpg.jpg" width="630" height="420" alt="" /></p><p><img src="/uploads-import/uploads/RTEmagicC_IMG_0120-web.jpg.jpg" width="630" height="420" alt="" /></p>

  <p>In Debrecen, Hungary, Czech Ombudsman Stanislav Křeček and his deputy Vít
  Alexander Schorm met with their counterparts from Slovakia, Hungary, and
  Poland for regular multilateral talks. This year's meeting was devoted mainly
  to the exchange of experiences with the protection of the rights of persons
  deprived of their liberty and the protection of the rights of persons with
  disabilities. Through their activities, ombudspersons perform the tasks of a
  national preventive mechanism under the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention
  against Torture, and most of them also perform the tasks of a monitoring body
  under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>

  <p>

  <i>„I greatly appreciate the opportunity to cooperate and engage in dialogue with my colleagues from the Visegrad Four countries. All four countries have a combined population of approximately 62.25 million, and their ombudsmen receive more than 40,000 complaints each year. At our joint meetings, we always discuss current and important issues that we encounter in our work in the field of human rights. All European institutions should operate on a similar principle of sharing experiences. I am convinced that meetings in this format have a long-term and irreplaceable benefit,"</i> said Ombudsman Stanislav Křeček about the summit.</p>

  <p>The ombudsmen also shared their methods for conducting unannounced visits to facilities, whether for the purpose of preventive protection against inhuman or degrading treatment or as part of monitoring the rights of persons with disabilities. 

  <i>„Together, we discussed, for example, the methodology and strategy for conducting visits to remand prisons and care facilities. We focused in particular on interviews with inmates and facility staff, documentation, and follow-up procedures. We also visited a brand new prison in Csenger, Hungary, designed for male prisoners under maximum security, built on the model of the most secure facilities of its kind in the world. It will be interesting to see what criticisms, if any, the national preventive mechanism for ill-treatment will have about the conditions in this facility with the benefit of hindsight,"</i> said Deputy Ombudsman Vít Alexander Schorm.</p>

  <strong>What is the National Preventive Mechanism?&nbsp;</strong>

  <br>Its purpose is to monitor the protection of the rights and dignity of persons deprived of their liberty in accordance with the obligations enshrined in the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT). In 2006, the Ombudsman's agenda was expanded for the first time to include oversight of restrictions on personal liberty. Since then, the Czech Ombudsman has been the national preventive mechanism, protecting persons deprived of their liberty from ill-treatment. The team supervising the restriction of personal liberty visits places where people are deprived of their liberty. For example, they visit children's homes, retirement homes, psychiatric hospitals, prisons, cells, and other facilities.

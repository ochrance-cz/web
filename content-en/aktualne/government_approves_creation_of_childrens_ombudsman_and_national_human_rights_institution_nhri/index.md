  <p>Following the Government&#39;s meeting on the amendment to the Ombudsman
  Act, the Public Defender of Rights Stanislav Křeček welcomed the Minister for
  Legislation&#39;s position on the institution of a Children&#39;s Ombudsman.
  The establishment of the Children&#39;s Ombudsman along with the expansion of
  the Ombudsman&#39;s mandate in the protection of human rights was approved by

<p><em>&bdquo;I welcome the opportunity to participate in the Cabinet meeting on the Ombudsman Amendment Bill, which would expand our current scope in the protection of human rights as a NHRI. The amendment also enshrines the creation of a new independent institution of the Children&#39;s Ombudsman. This is a major step towards improving the protection of children&#39;s rights,&quot;</em> said Ombudsman Stanislav Křeček after the government meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Czech Republic is one of the last European countries lacking a children&#39;s ombudsman. For these shortcomings, the state has long faced criticism from the UN, the Council of Europe and EU institutions, and in recent years, increasing reservations from representatives of czech civil society. Thanks to the amendment to the Ombudsman Act, the situation should change.</p>

<p><em>&quot;I appreciate the approach of the Minister for Legislation, Michal Šalomoun, to the staffing needs of this new institution. The Children&#39;s Ombudsman cannot fulfil the tasks assigned by the law alone, he needs enough experts to do so,&quot;</em> the Ombudsman added, adding that he is ready for further negotiations and debate on the future of the Children&#39;s Ombudsman both in the Chamber of Deputies and during the budgetary process.</p>

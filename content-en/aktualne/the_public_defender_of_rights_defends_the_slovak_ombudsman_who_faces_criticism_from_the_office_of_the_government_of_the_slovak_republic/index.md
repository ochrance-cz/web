perex: <p>Stanislav Křeček expresses his full support for the independent
  statements made by Róbert Dobrovodský, the Slovak Public Defender of Rights,
  who is facing public criticism from Prime Minister Robert Fico. The dispute
  concerns a petition submitted by the Slovak Ombudsman to the Constitutional
  Court of the Slovak Republic. The petition is directed against an amendment to
  the law regulating the activities of non-governmental organisations. This
  relates to the freedom of association of civil society. The Slovak Ombudsman
  considers the amendment incompatible with constitutionally guaranteed rights
  and freedoms.</p>

<p>“The role of the Public Defender of Rights is not to pander to current political moods, but to defend the constitutional order, human rights and the rule of law independently and consistently. Supporting civil society and safeguarding its freedoms are integral to the ombudsman's role. Others may adopt these views, even across the political spectrum. However, this does not mean that the ombudsman becomes part of the political struggle,” said Stanislav Křeček.</p>
<p>Stanislav Křeček believes that the independence and impartiality of the institution of the Public Defender of Rights is essential for its effective operation, and he urges respect for this function and for the Slovak Ombudsman himself. The Czech Ombudsman commends his Slovak counterpart for his courage and integrity in defending the right to freedom of association for civil society, as well as the free movement of capital within the EU — which are fundamental pillars of a democratic state governed by the rule of law. Submitting a petition to the Constitutional Court is a legitimate tool available to the Slovak Ombudsman to protect fundamental rights and freedoms, and Róbert Dobrovodský has this power by law as the Public Defender of Rights. This should not be used as a reason for personal attacks or for politicians to question his independence and impartiality.</p>

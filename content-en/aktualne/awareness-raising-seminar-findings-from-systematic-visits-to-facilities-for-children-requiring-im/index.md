The objective of these visits is to prevent ill-treatment.</p> <p>Findings and recommendations from the visits will be presented by lawyers of the Office of the Public Defender of Rights with a particular emphasis on the following topics:</p><ul><li>Assistance to a child and his/her family;</li><li>Child’s contact with his/her family;</li><li>Psychological assistance to children.</li></ul><p><img src="/uploads-import/uploads/RTEmagicC_norway-grants2_04.png.png" width="635" height="43" alt="" /></p>

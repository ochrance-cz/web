<p>His predecessor, the late Otakar Motejl, made two to three-times more recommendations every year, but deputies usually complied with few of them only.</p><p>Varvarovsky, who became ombudsman last September, said he reduced the number of proposals to those he considers of fundamental importance only.</p><p>He said the latest amendment to the employment law negates the sense and purpose of severance pay.</p><p>Under the amendment, a person who is entitled to a severance pay does not receive the unemployment benefit right after the loss of employment.</p><p>The amendment ignores the situation where the person does not get the severance, which happens in cases where he/she resigned from the job because the employer did not pay him/her the due wage.</p><p>&quot;It is naive to believe that someone who does not pay out the wage for half a year will pay out the severance sum,&quot; Varvarovsky said.</p><p>He also proposed that clear criteria for using restricting means in psychiatric clinics be defined.</p><p>Varvarovsky called on lawmakers to pass legislation giving title to orphan's pension even to the children whose parents did not pay pension insurance for the required period.</p><p>He also proposed that the smallest municipalities be not obliged to care for public roads because they do not have people for this agenda that is very complicated.</p><p>Brno, April 7 (CTK) &ndash; ms/dr/pv</p><br /><br />

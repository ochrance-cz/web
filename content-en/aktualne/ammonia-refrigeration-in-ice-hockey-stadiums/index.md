<p class="Normln" style="text-indent:0pt;">After a detailed analysis of the matter (including the drawing up of an expert opinion), the Defender stated on the question of the safety of indoor arenas that the statements of the addressed administrative authorities indicate serious shortcomings that may arise in the area of prevention of serious breakdowns. Within the inquiry, a working meeting took place in the Office of the Public Defender of Rights in September 2007 with participation of representatives of the Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry for Regional Development, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Chief Health Officer. Agreement was reached at the meeting in that the Ministry of the Environment in co-operation with the other departments would draw up an analysis of the safety situation in indoor arenas in the Czech Republic (the analysis was performed on the basis of the underlying documents provided on the matter by the addressed regional authorities). The departments concerned promised at another working meeting to perform co-ordinated inquiries inspecting the safety of the most risky facilities (joint inspections of the Czech Environmental Inspectorate and the State Labour Inspection Authority are to be carried out in selected premises in the second half of 2008).</p>

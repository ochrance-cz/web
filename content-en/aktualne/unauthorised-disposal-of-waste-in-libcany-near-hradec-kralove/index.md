<p class="Normln-web">The inquiry aims to review the steps of administrative authorities that did not prevent such extensive, unauthorised and hazardous conduct in time. Last but not least, the inquiry is aimed at ascertaining whether future prevention of similar situations has been ensured.</p>
<p class="Normln-web">In the inquiry the deputy participated in a meeting at the Ministry of the Environment where she acquainted herself in detail with the manner of keeping records of waste and the possibilities of detecting illegal waste management using the output from such records. (In this respect, the deputy commented on the draft amendment to the Act on Waste).</p>
<p class="Normln-web">A report on the inquiry was recently drawn up, in which the deputy points out that although the relevant administrative authorities performed a number of inspections, the latter were, unfortunately, insufficient as they were aimed at ascertaining “whether the company does correctly what it has been permitted to do, instead of ascertaining whether it is doing something that it has not been permitted to do”.</p>
<p class="Normln-web">The deputy also points out that the situation could be at least partly prevented had there been a higher degree of cooperation of the administrative authorities and a consequent use of their powers (possibility of entering other premises used for illegal activities).</p>
<p class="Normln-web">Furthermore, it is obvious from the report on the inquiry that the legal record-keeping in the area of waste management and the manner in which it was used failed to fulfil its role as a tool enabling detection of discrepancies in the flow of waste.</p>
<p class="Normln-web">Given the extraordinary seriousness of the case, the deputy recommends adoption of a number of specific remedial measures that will take two forms. On the one hand, there are application measures that may be implemented immediately and on the other hand, measures that require a change in the legislation.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Justice proposes to amend the Victims of Crime Act. The Ministry wants to extend the 3-month deadline for resolving the applications for financial assistance filed by victims of crime and the survivors of the victims. However, the purpose of providing financial assistance is to alleviate the negative and traumatic consequences of crime on the victims. In order for the assistance to be effective, it must also be timely. </p> <p>The Ministry wants to extend the 3-month deadline for resolving applications by a period necessary for “obtaining underlying documents for the decision from the criminal file.” However, the defender consider the 3-month period sufficient. Even if the Ministry faces problems with timely obtaining of all the necessary documents, it cannot pass its difficulties onto the victims of crime. On the contrary, it should help these victims to alleviate their difficult situation.  The Defender must consider unacceptable a state where the problems and difficulties faced by the victims of crime or their survivors were aggravated by postponing the time when they would receive financial compensation.</p> The Ministry of Justice finally accepted the Defender’s comments in the course of the commentary procedure.

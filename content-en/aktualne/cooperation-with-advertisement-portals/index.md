<p>In relation to research carried out in spring 2011, relating to the problem of discrimination in job advertisements, as part of which (on the basis of an analysis of more than 12,000 classified advertisements from the portals <a title="Opening in a new window" href="http://www.prace.cz/" target="_blank">www.prace.cz</a> <img alt="" src="https://www.ochrance.cz/typo3/ext/od_linkdesc/icons/external.gif" class="od_linkdesc_icon_external" /> and <a title="Opening in a new window" href="http://www.jobs.cz/" target="_blank">www.jobs.cz</a> <img alt="" src="https://www.ochrance.cz/typo3/ext/od_linkdesc/icons/external.gif" class="od_linkdesc_icon_external" />) it was found that one in every six classified advertisements contained one or even more discriminatory requirements for job applicants, the ombudsman began to work with the operator of these portals (LMC). It became apparent that advertisements classed as discriminatory were not generally placed on the portals with “malicious intent”, but rather as the result of a lack of information relating to protection against discrimination. As the ombdusman considers it important that further information about anti-discrimination law be provided to entrepreneurial subjects, in 2012 workshops will be organised for personnel officers and “human resources management” in collaboration with LMC. These workshops will enable participants to learn more about labour law and the principles of anti-discrimination.</p>

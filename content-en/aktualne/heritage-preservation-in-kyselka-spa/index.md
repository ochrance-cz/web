<p>In October 2009 the Public Defender of Rights issued a report on an inquiry in relation to the disrepair of a cultural monument – the premises of the former spa and Mattoni factory in Kyselka. </p><p>The Defender stated in the report on the inquiry that the case of the Kyselka spa is proof that the state was unable to provide for protection of the culturally protected buildings and it is therefore a question as to what extent there exists the state’s public interest in heritage preservation of the premises that are in such a pitiful condition <i>“under state supervision&quot;</i>. The Defender finds a critical moment in relation to the premises of the Mattoni factory in the permission for the new bottle-filling plant which, through its dimensions and design, entirely degrades the cultural heritage registered by the state. It seems that in permitting the construction of the new bottle-filling plant, the administrative bodies did not think at all about the possibility that existing culturally protected buildings could be further used (even partly) for production operations. They entirely neglected the necessity of incorporating the new production building into the premises of the cultural heritage in a manner favourable for the culturally protected buildings of the Mattoni factory. </p><p>Unfortunately, the condition of the culturally protected buildings in Kyselka is sad proof of how culturally protected buildings may end up if the owner’s inactivity is accompanied by inactivity of the state and its bodies, including the non-functioning institute of alternative enforcement of a decision. Now, following reminders, the Defender awaits a statement from the Ministry of Culture, which will be essential for further proceedings in the matter. </p>

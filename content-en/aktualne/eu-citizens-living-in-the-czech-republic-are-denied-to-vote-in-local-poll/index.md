Their fundamental right is not ensured. The ombudsman has already alerted Minister of Interior to this and asked him to amend the relevant law. </p><p>The ombudsman is convinced foreigners from EU countries with long-time residence permit in the Czech Republic could vote in this autumn's local elections already: &quot;Primary European law can be applied directly in this case, that is before the legislative procedure of changing laws is completed,&quot; Sabatova said and added that 160,000 foreigners from the EU countries are registered in the Czech Republic. Some 85,000 of them are Slovaks. A part of them have acquired a permanent residence permit so they already can vote. The ombudsman estimates that dozens of thousands of the EU citizens living in the Czech Republic cannot vote.</p><p>They naturally concentrate in large towns and their votes could mainly influence the composition of assemblies in Prague and Brno, the two largest cities in the country.</p>Foreigners from EU countries could already vote in the spring European Parliament elections thanks to the relevant legislation.

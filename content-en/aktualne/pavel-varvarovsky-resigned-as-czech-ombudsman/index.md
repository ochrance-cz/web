<p>Mr Pavel Varvarovsky resigned as Czech Public Defender of Rights. He held the post since 2010 and decided not to present the reasons of his resignation. However, he admitted the reasons do not rest inside the Ombudsman’s Office.</p><p>Varvarovsky, 68, former Constitutional Court judge, was the second Czech ombudsman, after the late Otakar Motejl. He has held the post since September 13, 2010. </p>Since the beginning he has made it clear that he does not cling to the post. He said this mainly while criticising what he called lawmakers' disrespect for his legislative recommendations that made him think about the sense of his mission.

<p class="Normln" style="text-indent:0pt;">A meeting was subsequently held at the Ministry of Finance, aimed at answering the question of why the Novartis preparation was supplied to the Czech Republic for a higher price than to other EU member states (except Slovakia). The representatives of the Ministry stated that the manufacturer had applied for the first registration of the pharmaceutical in the Czech Republic and thus there had not been any ordering price lists applicable to other European states at the time of fixing the maximum price. The offered price also seems to have been influenced by the low prevalence of the disease concerned in the Czech Republic and thus the prospect of a lower profit. It was agreed in conclusion of the meeting the Ministry would send to the deputy all the basic documents that had served for fixing the maximum price of Visudyne so that she could judge the procedure of the Ministry in a qualified manner and consider further procedure in the inquiry.</p>

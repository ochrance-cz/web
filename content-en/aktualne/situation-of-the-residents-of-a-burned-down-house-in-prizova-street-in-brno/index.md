<p class="Normln-web">An interim report on the inquiry was issued, which found maladministration by the Municipal Authority of the Brno-Centre Area in exercising the social and legal protection of children, the Brno Municipal Office in deciding on the benefits of aid in material need and the Brno-Centre Planning Authority, which was inactive in the matter. The findings during the inquiry proved among other things that the efficiency of aid to the families affected by the fire of the house at Přízová No. 16 in Brno had been considerably reduced by the impossibility of providing temporary housing to the families that had found themselves in adverse circumstances after the fire.</p>
<p class="Normln-web">The deputy currently awaits the response of the municipal area to her findings.</p>

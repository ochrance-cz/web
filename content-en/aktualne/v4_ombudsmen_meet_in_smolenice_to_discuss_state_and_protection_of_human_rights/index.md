<p>&quot;Our meetings of representatives of the V4 ombudsman institutions are unique in the political situation. We try to help on this platform by sharing knowledge and mutual cooperation,&quot; said czech ombudsman Stanislav Křeček.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s important that our mutual exchange of experience doesn&#39;t remain only at the level of formalities, but that we try to promote good examples and practical experience in our countries with the aim of increasing human-right standards,&quot; said slovak ombudsman Róbert Dobrovodský.</p>

<p>Ombudsmen are dedicated&nbsp; to the boundary between social policy and the fulfilment of obligations arising from social rights as fundamental rights: the right to housing, the competences of ombudsmen in relation to health insurers or what roles local government has in removing sources of noise in municipalities and towns.</p>

<p>Another topic of the summit is the legal arrangement of relations between landowners and the public sector in the V4 countries.&nbsp;They will settling up to terms with the &quot;legacy&quot; of socialism in the form of collectivisation of private land in the public interest.</p>

<p>The human rights aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic will also be discussed.&nbsp;In this context, ombudsmen from the V4 countries will share their findings and recommendations to prevent violations of fundamental rights and freedoms in the event of a similar situation.</p>

<p>They will also deal with the current challenges and experiences of the V4 countries with the performance of the mandate of the National Preventive Mechanism.&nbsp;Specifically, how it works in facilities where persons are deprived of their liberty, the human rights challenges posed by migratory flows, and more.&nbsp;</p>

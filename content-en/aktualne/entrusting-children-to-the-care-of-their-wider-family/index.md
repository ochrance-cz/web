<p class="Normln-web" style="text-decoration:none;">The ASLPC had not contacted the wider family in order to ascertain the possibility of entrusting the children to the care of family members even after the issue of the preliminary injunctions, in spite of the fact that the ASLPC should do so on its own initiative. The ASLPC personnel had begun to act only after they were repeatedly requested to do so by the children’s grandfather and uncle (they advised the grandfather of the possibility to lodge a proposal for entrusting the children to his care only during his second visit to the ASLPC). Nevertheless, after initial inactivity, the ASLPC began to deal with the children’s situation in a relatively intense manner. Now the ASLPC at least supports intensive contacts of the children with the family, their stays in the family on weekends and beyond and the entrusting of the youngest children into the care of the mother while the latter is serving her prison sentence. The Defender therefore closed the inquiry.</p>

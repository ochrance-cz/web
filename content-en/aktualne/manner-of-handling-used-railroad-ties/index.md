<p class="Normln-web" style="text-decoration:none;">The deputy released a report on the inquiry after receipt of the statements of both authorities. The report states that it is obvious from the provided materials that the ties are hazardous waste and she requests the Czech Environmental Inspectorate to perform an inspection of the handling of the waste at the originator of the waste (Railway Infrastructure Administration, state organisation). She simultaneously requested the Chief Public Health Officer that he publish a notice on the hazardous characteristics of the ties. The deputy of the Defender has already received the statements of both authorities on the report and drawn up the final statement with the remedial measures.</p>

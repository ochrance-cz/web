<p>This is conditional on a registration where the applicant receives a password that removes the need to enter the CAPTCHA code. A person may register as a standard user or user with disabilities. A person with disabilities may receive above-standard support in the form of remote assistance, where an employee of the Czech Office for Surveying, Mapping and Land Registry uses special software for remote control of the computer. The Deputy-Defender found no errors in this procedure.</p> <p>However, he had objections against the registration form, which did not include the applicant’s express consent to the processing of sensitive data and did not specify that a person should register as a user with disabilities only in case he or she wanted to receive above-standard support. The Czech Office for Surveying, Mapping and Land Registry modified the form in reaction to the Deputy’s objections. Simultaneously, it stated on its website that if a person with disabilities did not require above-standard support, he or she may register as a standard user (without stating any disabilities).</p>

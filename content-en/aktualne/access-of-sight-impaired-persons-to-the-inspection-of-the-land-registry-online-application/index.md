  <p>The Deputy-Defender inquired into the&nbsp;conditions under which sight
  impaired persons are able to use the&nbsp;&ldquo;Inspection of the&nbsp;Land
  Registry&rdquo; online application without entering CAPTCHA codes.</p>

<p>This is conditional on a&nbsp;registration where the&nbsp;applicant receives a&nbsp;password that removes the&nbsp;need to enter the&nbsp;CAPTCHA code. A&nbsp;person may register as a&nbsp;standard user or user with disabilities. A&nbsp;person with disabilities may receive above-standard support in the&nbsp;form of remote assistance, where an&nbsp;employee of the&nbsp;Czech Office for Surveying, Mapping and Land Registry uses special software for remote control of the&nbsp;computer. The&nbsp;Deputy-Defender found no errors in this procedure.</p>

<p>However, he had objections against the&nbsp;registration form, which did not include the&nbsp;applicant&rsquo;s express consent to the&nbsp;processing of sensitive data and did not specify that a&nbsp;person should register as a&nbsp;user with disabilities only in case he or she wanted to receive above-standard support. The&nbsp;Czech Office for Surveying, Mapping and Land Registry modified the&nbsp;form in reaction to the&nbsp;Deputy&rsquo;s objections. Simultaneously, it stated on its website that if a&nbsp;person with disabilities did not require above-standard support, he or she may register as a&nbsp;standard user (without stating any disabilities).</p>

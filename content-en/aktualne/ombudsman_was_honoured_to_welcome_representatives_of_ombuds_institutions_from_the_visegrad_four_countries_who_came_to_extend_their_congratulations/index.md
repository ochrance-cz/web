  <p>Marking a significant milestone, the Czech Ombudsman celebrated its 25th
  anniversary with a special gathering in Brno, welcoming representatives from
  ombuds institutions of the Visegrad Four countries, who arrived to offer their
  congratulations. Among the distinguished guests were Róbert Dobrovodský, the
  Public Defender of Rights of the Slovak Republic; Jozef Mikloško, the
  Commissioner for Children of Slovakia; Ákos Kozma, the Commissioner for
  Fundamental Rights of Hungary; and Adam Krzywoń, Deputy Ombudsman of the
  Republic of Poland. Each of them highlighted the fruitful cooperation shared
  among the Visegrad Four through regular summits and working meetings. In their
  addresses, they emphasised the vital role that ombuds institutions play in
  maintaining a balance between state authority and the protection of individual
  rights.</p>

<p>In addition to reflecting on regional cooperation, the representatives expressed a shared commitment to upholding human dignity and promoting transparent governance. Their presence underscored not only the strength of existing partnerships, but also a collective vision for continued collaboration in the defence of fundamental rights. The guests extended their best wishes to the Czech Ombudsman in developing the new agenda for the Children's Ombudsman, noting that their own countries have had diverse experiences with this role.</p>

<p>Poland has had a Children's Ombudsman since 2000, making it the longest-standing among the V4.&nbsp;Slovakia followed 16 years later with its “Little Ombudsman,” as the role is colloquially known. Hungary, on the other hand, does not have a separate Children's Ombudsman. Children's rights are protected by the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;While children across the region face similar challenges, each country approaches the role of Children's Ombudsman in its own way. The Czech model is distinct: the Children's Ombudsman will be housed under the same roof as the Public Defender of Rights. This structure will ensure continuity in our existing efforts, promote knowledge sharing, and strengthen mutual support.</p>

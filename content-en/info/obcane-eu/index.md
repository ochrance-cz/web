<p>Thanks to European Union every member state designated one or more bodies which provides help to EU citizens abroad and thus contributes to the&nbsp;full exercise of free movement of EU citizens. The&nbsp;list of the&nbsp;bodies is available at 
<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1277&amp;langId=en">European Commission webpage</a>. The&nbsp;Defender is the&nbsp;designated body in the&nbsp;Czech Republic.</p>
<p>The Defender may be contacted by people who faced unequal treatment on grounds of their nationality and who are EU citizens (i. e. citizens of a&nbsp;member state of the&nbsp;European Union) or members of their family (even if they are not EU citizens themselves).&nbsp;Citizens from countries of the&nbsp;European Economic Area (Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein) enjoy the&nbsp;same rights as EU citizens.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.ochrance.cz/uploads-import/DISKRIMINACE/pravni_predpisy/Anti-discrimination-Act.pdf">Antidiscrimination Act</a>&nbsp;prohibits discrimination of workers (employees) from other EU member states and their family members primarily in access to employment and conditions of employment, especially as regards working conditions, remuneration, promotion, health and safety at work or membership in trade unions; further also in the&nbsp;access to social and tax advantages, training, housing and as regards assistance afforded by the&nbsp;employment offices.</p>
<p>Main tasks of the&nbsp;Defender in this area are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide information to EU citizens about their rights, who to contact and how to proceed</li>
<li>Provide methodical assistance in cases of alleged discrimination on grounds of nationality and advises how to submit an&nbsp;application to initiate proceedings on the&nbsp;grounds of discrimination</li>
<li>Communicate with public authorities and private persons in cases regarding the&nbsp;exercise of the&nbsp;right of free movement and equal treatment on grounds of nationality</li>
<li>Carry out research, publish reports and recommendations in the&nbsp;area of the&nbsp;free movement of EU citizens and equal treatment on grounds of nationality</li>
<li>Communicate with bodies in other member states who have been designated to fulfil the&nbsp;same tasks</li></ul>
<p>The aim of the&nbsp;Defender in this field is to facilitate the&nbsp;free movement of workers across European Union. EU citizens have the&nbsp;right to move freely to another member state in order to work there and they have the&nbsp;right to be treated equally as nationals of that state. Free movement of workers is guaranteed in founding treaties – in the&nbsp;Treaty on the&nbsp;Functioning of the&nbsp;European Union and is further specified in subsequent legal acts. EU citizens and their family members enjoy the&nbsp;right of equal treatment as regards access to employment, conditions of employment and work, in particular with regard to remuneration, dismissal, and tax and social advantages. The&nbsp;Defender acts as a&nbsp;contact point for people who face problems in above specified areas. The&nbsp;Defender can also deal with cases submitted by persons who are not Union workers (person with income from other sources than employment, students,&nbsp;etc.), even if they don’t enjoy the&nbsp;right of equal treatment in all cases.</p>

The aim of the workshop was to present the results of an extensive survey of EU citizens in the Czech Republic, which found out how EU citizens live in the Czech Republic and what problems they face, and also to discuss the Defender's recommendations based on this research.&nbsp;Here you can watch&nbsp;

A&nbsp;profession is regulated if the&nbsp;law stipulates specific conditions for its performance, such as education in a&nbsp;specific field, certain length of practice or medical fitness.</li>
<li>If you wish to perform a&nbsp;regulated profession, you should make an&nbsp;application to a&nbsp;recognition body. The&nbsp;list of regulated professions in the&nbsp;Czech Republic and their respective recognition bodies, as well as specific requirements, is available in the&nbsp;

<h3>Entry and residence in the&nbsp;territory of the&nbsp;Czech Republic</h3>
<ul>
<li>As EU&nbsp;national you may&nbsp;
<a href="https://ipc.gov.cz/en/obligations-for-foreigners/arrival-in-the-czech-republic-eu/">enter</a> freely the&nbsp;territory of&nbsp;Czechia and enjoy freedom of&nbsp;movement here. It&nbsp;is sufficient to&nbsp;travel with a&nbsp;valid ID&nbsp;card and/or a&nbsp;passport. (
<a href="https://ipc.gov.cz/en/">https://ipc.gov.cz/en/</a> → Obligations →EU Citizens and their Family Members → Arrival to the Czech Republic)</li>
<li>
<strong>Refusal of&nbsp;entry</strong>– The&nbsp;Police of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic may refuse your entry into the&nbsp;territory of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic. They may do&nbsp;so for instance in&nbsp;cases when you have no&nbsp;valid travel document (passport or&nbsp;ID card) and are unable to&nbsp;prove your identity by&nbsp;another document. Another example is&nbsp;if an&nbsp;alert has been issued with respect to&nbsp;you in&nbsp;the&nbsp;national records of&nbsp;undesirable persons and if&nbsp;reasonable danger pertains that you might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;threat to&nbsp;the&nbsp;security of&nbsp;the&nbsp;state or&nbsp;seriously impede public policy of&nbsp;the&nbsp;state. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule the&nbsp;Police has to&nbsp;issue a&nbsp;decision on&nbsp;refusal of&nbsp;entry. There are only a&nbsp;few exemptions to&nbsp;this rule. </li>
<li>In case you intend to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic for a&nbsp;period&nbsp;
<strong>longer than 30&nbsp;days</strong>, you have to&nbsp;register your stay at&nbsp;the&nbsp;Police of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic. In&nbsp;such a&nbsp;case, within 30&nbsp;days from entry into the&nbsp;Czech Republic you have to&nbsp;inform the&nbsp;local department of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Foreign Police (competent&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.policie.cz/clanek/oddeleni-pobytovych-agend.aspx">depending on&nbsp;your place</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;stay) that you are present in&nbsp;the&nbsp;territory.</li>
<li>In case you intend to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;the&nbsp;territory for&nbsp;
<strong>longer than 3&nbsp;months</strong>, you may apply for a&nbsp;
<a href="https://ipc.gov.cz/en/visa-and-residence-permit-types/eu-nationals/registration-certificate/">registration certificate</a> (https://ipc.gov.cz/en/ → Visa and residence permit types → EU Citizens and Their Family Members → Registration Certificate).</li>
<li>
<strong>After 5&nbsp;years of&nbsp;continuous temporary stay</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic, you may ask for a&nbsp;
<a href="https://ipc.gov.cz/en/visa-and-residence-permit-types/eu-nationals/permanent-residence-permit-of-an-eu-citizen/">permanent residence permit</a> (
<a href="https://ipc.gov.cz/en/">https://ipc.gov.cz/en/</a> → Visa and residence permit types → EU Citizens and Their Family Members → Permanent Residence of an EU Citizen). In&nbsp;some cases you may file an&nbsp;application for permanent residence permit even sooner than that (e.&nbsp;g. in&nbsp;case you are a&nbsp;spouse of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Czech national). </li>

<strong>any</strong>&nbsp;embassy of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic. Once the&nbsp;embassy receives your application, it&nbsp;will determine the&nbsp;date of&nbsp;a&nbsp;meeting. Please check at&nbsp;the&nbsp;embassy whether you have to&nbsp;be accompanied by&nbsp;an&nbsp;interpreter from your language before you go&nbsp;to that meeting. In&nbsp;case the&nbsp;closest embassy is&nbsp;too far away from your place of&nbsp;residence, when lodging your application you may request that further communication with you is&nbsp;by e-mail.</li></ul>

<li>
<strong>Refusal of&nbsp;entry</strong>&nbsp;– in&nbsp;exceptional cases it&nbsp;may happen that the&nbsp;police refuses your entry in&nbsp;the&nbsp;territory and shall annul your visa. Refusals of&nbsp;entry are most common due to&nbsp;the&nbsp;fact that a&nbsp;foreigner has not submitted a&nbsp;valid visa or&nbsp;residence permit (while being from a&nbsp;state with a&nbsp;visa duty). Another reasons for refusal of&nbsp;entry are that there is&nbsp;reasonable danger that you might represents a&nbsp;danger for public policy or&nbsp;public security for the&nbsp;state or&nbsp;another state. Another reason for a&nbsp;refusal of&nbsp;entry may be&nbsp;the&nbsp;fact that you do&nbsp;not have a&nbsp;valid travel document (passport or&nbsp;ID) and cannot prove your identity by&nbsp;another document. </li>
<li>
<strong>After arrival to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic</strong>, it&nbsp;is necessary that you report at&nbsp;the&nbsp;department of&nbsp;Foreign Police [

<h3>Health insurance and health care</h3>
<ul>
<li>Health care – as an&nbsp;EU citizen you have the&nbsp;right for the&nbsp;same health care as Czech citizens</li>
<li>You may file a&nbsp;complaint if you are not satisfied with the&nbsp;quality of health care that you received or with the&nbsp;conduct of medical staff, more information 
<a href="https://www.mzcr.cz/Cizinci/obsah/procedure-for-filing-a-complaint-against-healthcare-received_2656_23.html">here</a> (
<a href="http://www.mzcr.cz/cizinci">www.mzcr.cz/cizinci</a> → Procedure for filing a&nbsp;complaint against healthcare received)</li>
<li>You may be insured in public health insurance system only in one European Union country</li>
<li>The country of insurance is the&nbsp;country where you work either as an&nbsp;employee or as a&nbsp;self-employed person (with the&nbsp;exception of temporary posting of workers or seasonal workers, special rules apply to frontier workers)</li>
<li>If you are not an&nbsp;employee nor a&nbsp;self-employed person, your country of insurance is most probably the&nbsp;country where you habitually reside, more information 
<a href="https://www.kancelarzp.cz/en/temp-in-cr/eu-insured-temporary">here</a> (kancelarzp.cz → Temporary stay in CZ → EU insured person)</li>
<li>Health insurance premium –&nbsp;if you are employed under labour contract, the&nbsp;premium is deducted directly from your wages (work under agreement to complete a&nbsp;job or agreement to perform work is not considered as work under labour contract); if you are not, you have to pay the&nbsp;premium yourself – ask your health insurance company</li>
<li>If you are insured in another EU country, upon presentation of EHIC card (blue card proving public health insurance in EU) you are entitled to necessary health care in the&nbsp;Czech Republic</li>
<li>You have to notify your health insurance company about all changes of personal data (name and surname, address, change of employment)</li>
<li>Some insurance companies offer also private health insurance, but that does not necessarily cover all health care and usually is less advantageous than public health insurance</li>
<li>If you terminate your work in one country and plan to move to another, it is recommended to collect certificate proving the&nbsp;duration of your health insurance</li>
<li>For more information see 
<a href="https://www.kancelarzp.cz/index.php/en">https://www.kancelarzp.cz/index.php/en</a></li></ul>
<h3>Social security</h3>
<ul>
<li>In order to make it easier for EU citizens to move and work abroad, EU has adopted rules for determination which country is responsible for payment of social security benefits</li>
<li>Under these rules you may be subject to legislation of only one country – the&nbsp;country of insurance</li>
<li>The country of insurance is the&nbsp;country where you work either as an&nbsp;employee or as a&nbsp;self-employed person (with the&nbsp;exception of temporary posting of workers or seasonal workers, special rules apply to frontier workers). If you don’t work, the&nbsp;country of insurance is usually the&nbsp;country of your residence</li>
<li>In the&nbsp;country of insurance you should have equal access to social security contributions as its citizens</li>
<li>When deciding about your entitlement to social security benefits, the&nbsp;competent institution takes into account periods of insurance, employment or self-employment completed in other EU countries</li>
<li>Social security contributions –&nbsp;if you are employed under labour contract, the&nbsp;contributions are deducted directly from your wages; if you are not, you have pay the&nbsp;contributions yourself – ask the&nbsp;local office of the&nbsp;Social Security Administration [Okresní správa sociálního zabezpečení]</li>
<li>In some cases you may be asked by social security institution or Labour Office to fill in a&nbsp;questionnaire to find out what your country of residence is</li>
<li>You may ask the&nbsp;Social Security Administration for more information on pensions (retirement or invalidity), sickness benefits, maternity or paternity benefits; or the&nbsp;Labour Office for more information on unemployment benefits, family benefits, assistance in material need</li>
<li>If you terminate your work in one country and plan to move to another, it is recommended to collect certificate proving the&nbsp;duration of your social insurance (ask labour authority office in the&nbsp;country of work)</li>

<h3>Sale of goods and services</h3>
<ul>
<li>Providers of goods and services may not discriminate against the&nbsp;service recipient/buyer on grounds of her nationality, if there is no objectively justifiable ground. If you feel discriminated, you may file a&nbsp;complaint to the&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.coi.cz/en">Czech Trade Inspection Authority [Česká obchodní inspekce]</a>.</li>
<li>Provision of financial services (loan, mortgage, insurance) has its specificities. In case of discrimination, you may file a&nbsp;complaint to the&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.cnb.cz/en/supervision-financial-market/consumer-protection-and-financial-literacy/consumer-protection/index.html">Czech National Bank</a>&nbsp;[Česká národní banka] (
<a href="http://www.cnb.cz/en">www.cnb.cz/en</a> → Supervision, regulation → Consumer protection and financial literacy → Consumer protection), or in case of consumer credit provided by non-bank consumer credit providers to Czech Trade Inspection Authority [Česká obchodní inspekce].</li>
<li>It is important that everyone who legally resides in the&nbsp;Czech Republic or another EU country has the&nbsp;right to opening one basic payment 
<a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/financial-products-and-services/bank-accounts-eu/index_en.htm">account</a>.</li>

<h3>Taxes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Payment of income taxes depends on whether you are a&nbsp;tax resident or tax non-resident. If you are a&nbsp;Czech 
<strong>tax resident</strong>, you have unlimited tax obligation, i.e. you are taxed on your worldwide income. If you are a&nbsp;Czech 
<strong>tax non-resident</strong>, you are taxed only on your Czech-source income.</li>
<li>It is not always easy to determine tax residency. The&nbsp;rules are to be found in the&nbsp;Act on Income Taxes [zákon o daních z příjmů]. If you are a&nbsp;tax resident of more countries, take a&nbsp;look in the&nbsp;treaty on avoidance of double taxation between the&nbsp;respective country and the&nbsp;Czech Republic, the&nbsp;list is available 
<a href="https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/legislativa/dvoji-zdaneni/prehled-platnych-smluv">here</a>, only in Czech (
<a href="https://www.mfcr.cz/en/">https://www.mfcr.cz/en/</a> → Themes → Taxes → Double taxation).</li>
<li>Tax residency is usually determined according to this criteria (successively): 1.&nbsp;permanent home, 2.&nbsp;centre of vital interests, 3.&nbsp;habitual residence (in the&nbsp;Czech Republic at least 183&nbsp;days in a&nbsp;year), 4.&nbsp;state citizenship. If you live and work in the&nbsp;Czech Republic for the&nbsp;whole year, you will most probably be Czech tax resident. But it depends on several circumstances, so in case of doubt is better to find professional assistance.</li>
<li>Income tax obligation is usually different if you are an&nbsp;employee or if you are self-employed.</li>
<li>If you live and work in the&nbsp;territory of the&nbsp;Czech Republic, you usually have to pay income tax from your salary or wages. If you are employed, your employer usually deducts the&nbsp;advance income tax. You may ask the&nbsp;employer to make annual statement of tax [roční zúčtování daně] (every year till 15th February), or you may file a&nbsp;tax declaration [daňové přiznání] yourself (every year till 1st April). If you are self-employed, you have to file the&nbsp;tax declaration yourself.</li>

<li>In any case, we recommend you to ask a&nbsp;tax adviser for help. The&nbsp;list of income tax advisers, who speak English, is available

<h3>Education and schools</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are two types of school in the&nbsp;Czech Republic – public and private.</li>
<li>Public schools (elementary, high, 
<a href="http://www.msmt.cz/areas-of-work/tertiary-education/czech-education-system">college</a>) are free of charge. Kindergarten is usually not free of charge. You should count with other expenses for snacks and lunches anyway.</li>
<li>Private schools are not free of charge. School fees are different in each school.</li>
<li>It may be rather difficult to find a&nbsp;suitable school for your children. If there more than one schools (nursery schools, elementary school) in your city, the&nbsp;city has a&nbsp;duty to define school districts. For each school district one local school [spádová škola] is given. Children resident in school district of the&nbsp;local school have priority in enrolment procedure. Ask the&nbsp;municipality authority, which school in the&nbsp;city is your local school.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.msmt.cz/areas-of-work/preschool-education">Preschool education</a> – Preschool education is the&nbsp;initial level of public education organised and governed by the&nbsp;requirements and instructions of the&nbsp;Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports [Ministerstvo školství, mládeže a&nbsp;tělovýchovy]. Last year of nursery school is called pre-school year. Every pre-school child is obliged to attend the&nbsp;kindergarten and the&nbsp;municipalities guarantee a&nbsp;place for your child. Otherwise, this child will not be allowed to attend the&nbsp;first year of elementary school. (
<a href="http://www.msmt.cz/">www.msmt.cz</a> → Areas of Work → Preschool Education)</li>
<li>Elementary school – Children in the&nbsp;Czech Republic are obliged to attend the&nbsp;elementary for 9&nbsp;years (usually between 6-15 y.).</li>
<li>High school – there are several types of high schools. For more information, visit this 
<a href="https://www.studyin.cz/soubory/clanky/0021_publications/StudyIN-EduSystem-2017.pdf">website</a> (

<li>For those children, whose mother tongue is other language than Czech (children with different mother tongue, in Czech „děti s&nbsp;OMJ“), there are several supportive measures. The&nbsp;aim of supportive measures is to adapt children’s education in the&nbsp;Czech Republic. For more information, ask

<h3>Housing</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are two types of housing in the&nbsp;Czech Republic – private and council housing</li>
<li>It is important to report your residence to the&nbsp;appropriate Foreign Police Department that holds jurisdiction in the&nbsp;location of your stay in the&nbsp;Czech Republic (Policie ČR, 
<a href="https://www.policie.cz/clanek/oddeleni-pobytovych-agend.aspx">odbor cizinecké policie</a>).</li>
<li>You can also buy own house/flat or you can eventually rent one. There are lot of websites, where you can find some accommodation.

<h3>Registration of vehicles and driving licences</h3>
<p>Driving licences issued in one country of the&nbsp;European Union are automatically recognized in other EU countries. If you move to another EU country for a&nbsp;period longer than 6&nbsp;months, you are obliged to register your vehicle in the&nbsp;new country. Deadlines for registration depend on each country, in the&nbsp;Czech Republic it is 10&nbsp;workdays. Registration is carried out by local municipal authority [obecní úřad obce s rozšířenou působností] in the&nbsp;place of your residence. The&nbsp;registration of a&nbsp;vehicle is connected with the&nbsp;obligation to have compulsory third party liability insurance valid in the&nbsp;country where you reside.

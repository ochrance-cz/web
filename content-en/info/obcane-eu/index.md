title: Citizens of the European Union
---

Thanks to European Union every member state designated one or more bodies which provides help to EU citizens abroad and thus contributes to the full exercise of free movement of EU citizens. The list of the bodies is available at [European Commission webpage](http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1277&langId=en). The Defender is the designated body in the Czech Republic.

The Defender may be contacted by people who faced unequal treatment on grounds of their nationality and who are EU citizens (i. e. citizens of a member state of the European Union) or members of their family (even if they are not EU citizens themselves). Citizens from countries of the European Economic Area (Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein) enjoy the same rights as EU citizens.

[Antidiscrimination Act](https://test.ochrance.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/DISKRIMINACE/pravni_predpisy/Anti-discrimination-Act.pdf)  prohibits discrimination of workers (employees) from other EU member states and their family members primarily in access to employment and conditions of employment, especially as regards working conditions, remuneration, promotion, health and safety at work or membership in trade unions; further also in the access to social and tax advantages, training, housing and as regards assistance afforded by the employment offices.

Main tasks of the Defender in this area are to:

- Provide information to EU citizens about their rights, who to contact and how to proceed

- Provide methodical assistance in cases of alleged discrimination on grounds of nationality and advises how to submit an application to initiate proceedings on the grounds of discrimination

- Communicate with public authorities and private persons in cases regarding the exercise of the right of free movement and equal treatment on grounds of nationality

- Carry out research, publish reports and recommendations in the area of the free movement of EU citizens and equal treatment on grounds of nationality

- Communicate with bodies in other member states who have been designated to fulfil the same tasks

The aim of the Defender in this field is to facilitate the free movement of workers across European Union. EU citizens have the right to move freely to another member state in order to work there and they have the right to be treated equally as nationals of that state. Free movement of workers is guaranteed in founding treaties – in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and is further specified in subsequent legal acts. EU citizens and their family members enjoy the right of equal treatment as regards access to employment, conditions of employment and work, in particular with regard to remuneration, dismissal, and tax and social advantages. The Defender acts as a contact point for people who face problems in above specified areas. The Defender can also deal with cases submitted by persons who are not Union workers (person with income from other sources than employment, students, etc.), even if they don’t enjoy the right of equal treatment in all cases.

More information on how the Defender may assist you is available [here](https://test.ochrance.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Letaky/A_-_OBCANE_Evropske_unie_-_III._18.pdf) .

- Even in the case of agency employment, the principle of equal treatment must be respected. The user (employer) must not discriminate you against your core employees.

- Details of agency employment can be found [here](https://www.uradprace.cz/web/en/employment-agencies-1).

### Entry and residence in the territory of the Czech Republic

- As EU national you may enter freely the territory of the Czech Republic and have freedom of movement here. It is sufficient to travel with a valid ID card and/or a passport. ([webpage](https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/entering-the-czech-republic.aspx) [https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/](https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/) &rarr; Useful Information &rarr; Immigration &rarr; EU citizens and their family members)

- **Refusal of entry**– The Police of the Czech Republic may refuse your entry into the territory of the Czech Republic. They may do so for instance in cases when you have no valid travel document (passport or ID card) and are unable to prove your identity by another document. Another example is if an alert has been issued with respect to you in the national records of undesirable persons and if reasonable danger pertains that you might be a threat to the security of the state or seriously impede public policy of the state. As a rule the Police has to issue a decision on refusal of entry. There are only a few exemptions to this rule. You may learn here what remedy is available against such a decision: Remedies.

- In case you intend to stay in the Czech Republic for a period **longer than 30 days**, you have to register your stay at the Police of the Czech Republic. In such a case, within 30 days from entry into the Czech Republic you have to inform the local department of the Foreign Police (competent [depending on your place](https://www.policie.cz/clanek/oddeleni-pobytovych-agend.aspx) of stay) that you are present in the territory.

- In case you intend to stay in the territory for **longer than 3 months**, you may apply for a [certificate of your temporary stay](https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/temporary-residence.aspx). No fee is required for lodging the application.

- **After 5 years of continuous temporary stay** in the Czech Republic, you may ask for a [permanent residence permit](https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/eu-citizens-and-their-family-members-permanent-residence.aspx). In some cases you may file an application for permanent residence permit even sooner than that (e. g. in case you are a spouse of a Czech national). Again, no fee is required for lodging the application.

- **Application forms** for a certificate of temporary stay or permanent residence permit can be downloaded [here](https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/application-forms.aspx?q=Y2hudW09Nw%3d%3d)  and [here](https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/application-forms.aspx?q=Y2hudW09Ng%3d%3d) . ([https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/](https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/) Useful Information &rarr; Immigration &rarr; EU citizens and their family members &rarr; Application Requirements)

- **Application forms** have to be filled **in in Czech** (or Slovak) language. In general, any other documents in a foreign language have to be submitted in their original, but you also have to submit an official translation into the Czech language. Unless you can speak Czech, you will need assistance from an interpreter. You bear the costs of translation or interpretation. You may search for official translators and/or interpreters [in this list](http://datalot.justice.cz/justice/repznatl.nsf/$$SearchForm) .

- In case you are issued a certificate of temporary stay, a **[birth registration number](https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/identity-number.aspx)** will also be assigned to you. This number is a personal identification number and it is essential when you pay your health and social insurance or taxes.

- **Refusal to issue or revocation of a temporary residence certificate**– Ministry of Interior may refuse to issue a temporary residence certificate (if you became a burden on the social assistance for persons with disabilities or the assistance system in material need; there is a reasonable risk that you could endanger state security or seriously disrupt public order; you are registered in the register of undesirable persons and there is still a reasonable risk that you might endanger state security or seriously disrupt public order) or [revoke it](https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/ending-and-revoking-a-residence-permit-and-leaving-the-cr.aspx?q=Y2hudW09Mg%3d%3d) . In both cases the ministry will issue a decision and set forth a deadline within which you have to leave the country. You will learn below what steps you may take to appeal such a decision.

- **Refusal to issue or revocation** **of a permanent residence permit** – the Ministry of Interior may refuse or [revoke](https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/ending-and-revoking-a-residence-permit-and-leaving-the-cr.aspx?q=Y2hudW09Mg%3d%3d)  your permanent residence permit. The ministry will issue a decision which can be appealed against. You may find below what remedies are available. You may find more information about the reasons for refusal or revocation of either temporary residence certificate or permanent residence permit at the [webpage of Ministry of Interior](https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/ending-and-revoking-a-residence-permit-and-leaving-the-cr.aspx?q=Y2hudW09Mg%3d%3d) ([https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/](https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/) Useful Information &rarr; Immigration &rarr; EU citizens and their family members).

- **Expulsion (forced return)** – you may find information on remedies in cases of administrative expulsion in the part Remedies. The reasons for expulsion are as follows:

  -  **temporary residence certificate** – the Police of the Czech Republic may expel you in case you are a threat to the security of the state; if you seriously threaten the public policy (unless you have stayed in the Czech Republic continuously for at least ten years, disregarding any time you have served a custodial sentence); or threaten public health by suffering from an illness listed in the requirements of a measure against bringing in infectious illnesses, unless you have caught the illness longer than 3 months after your entry in the territory.

  - **permanent residence permit** – in case you have a permanent residence permit the Police may only expel you in case you are a serious threat to the security of the state or in case you seriously impede the public policy and it is not sufficient to revoke your permit, given the gravity of your acts.

**Exception**: A decision on administrative expulsion **cannot be issued** a) in case of minors (persons younger than 18 years) unless this would be in their best interest b)    in case you have stayed in the Czech Republic longer than 10 years (unless you are a particularly serious threat to the security of the state).\*\*

- **Important notice!** Should your decision on refusal of entry, revocation or refusal to issue a permit or certificate or expulsion decision be based on confidential information, the reasons will only be included in the decision to the extent to which they are not confidential. Should the decision be based on you being a threat to the state security, the decision will only include a statement that the reason is‚ threat to the security of the state without further explanation. Even in such cases the decision **has to contain** assessment whether the impact of the decision is proportionate to your right to a family and private life.

- **Remedies** – information on how to appeal against entry ban, refusal to issue or revocation a certificate of temporary residence or permanent residence permit is available in part Remedies.

- You may acquire more information and useful contacts at the [webpage of Ministry of Interior](https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/immigration-contacts-contacts.aspx) or may call at the [hotline of the Ministry of Interior](https://www.mvcr.cz/docDetail.aspx?docid=21679744&doctype=ART) ([https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/](https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/) Useful Information &rarr; Immigration &rarr; Contacts).

- **Entry** – when arriving at the territory of the Czech Republic, it is distinguished whether family members come from a country with a visa duty to enter the Czech Republic or from a visa-free country. Citizens of certain states have duty to apply for a visa.

In case the closest embassy is too far away from your place of residence, when lodging your application you may request that further communication with you is by email.

**The embassy has to issue a decision on your application within 14 days. More information about remedies against refusal of your application follows in the part _Remedies_.**

- **Refusal of entry** – in exceptional cases it may happen that the police refuses your entry in the territory and shall annul your visa. Refusals of entry are most common due to the fact that a foreigner has not submitted a valid visa or residence permit (while being from a state with a visa duty). Another reasons for refusal of entry are that there is reasonable danger that you might represents a danger for public policy or public security for the state or another state. Another reason for a refusal of entry may be the fact that you do not have a valid travel document (passport or ID) and cannot prove your identity by another document. You may find information about how to appeal against a refusal of entry in the part _Remedies_.

During the course of the proceedings you have the right of residence in the Czech Republic and the right to work, in case this has been your first application.

- **Important!** In case a decision on refusal of entry, expulsion decision, refusal to grant residence permit or revocation of such a permit is based also on **classified information**, reasons shall only be stated to the extent to which they do not fall within classified information. Should the decision be based on you being a threat to the state security, the decision will only include a statement that the reason is ‚threat to the security of the state‘ without further explanation. Even in such cases the decision **has to contain** assessment whether the impact of the decision is proportionate to your right to a family and private life.

- **Important notice!** In case classified information was used to refuse your entry, reject your application for a residence permit, revoke your residence permit or for your expulsion decision, the same applies as for EU citizens (see Entry and Residence).

### Health insurance and health care

- Health care – as an EU citizen you have the right for the same health care as Czech citizens

- You may file a complaint if you are not satisfied with the quality of health care that you received or with the conduct of medical staff, more information [here](https://www.mzcr.cz/Cizinci/obsah/procedure-for-filing-a-complaint-against-healthcare-received_2656_23.html) ([www.mzcr.cz/cizinci](http://www.mzcr.cz/cizinci) &rarr; Procedure for filing a complaint against healthcare received)

- You may be insured in public health insurance system only in one European Union country

- The country of insurance is the country where you work either as an employee or as a self-employed person (with the exception of temporary posting of workers or seasonal workers, special rules apply to frontier workers)

- If you are not an employee nor a self-employed person, your country of insurance is most probably the country where you habitually reside, more information [here](https://www.kancelarzp.cz/en/temp-in-cr/eu-insured-temporary) (kancelarzp.cz &rarr; Temporary stay in CZ &rarr; EU insured person)

- Health insurance premium – if you are employed under labour contract, the premium is deducted directly from your wages (work under agreement to complete a job or agreement to perform work is not considered as work under labour contract); if you are not, you have to pay the premium yourself – ask your health insurance company

- If you are insured in another EU country, upon presentation of EHIC card (blue card proving public health insurance in EU) you are entitled to necessary health care in the Czech Republic

- You have to notify your health insurance company about all changes of personal data (name and surname, address, change of employment)

- Some insurance companies offer also private health insurance, but that does not necessarily cover all health care and usually is less advantageous than public health insurance

- If you terminate your work in one country and plan to move to another, it is recommended to collect certificate proving the duration of your health insurance

- For more information see [https://www.kancelarzp.cz/index.php/en](https://www.kancelarzp.cz/index.php/en)

### Social security

- In order to make it easier for EU citizens to move and work abroad, EU has adopted rules for determination which country is responsible for payment of social security benefits

- Under these rules you may be subject to legislation of only one country – the country of insurance

- The country of insurance is the country where you work either as an employee or as a self-employed person (with the exception of temporary posting of workers or seasonal workers, special rules apply to frontier workers). If you don’t work, the country of insurance is usually the country of your residence

- In the country of insurance you should have equal access to social security contributions as its citizens

- When deciding about your entitlement to social security benefits, the competent institution takes into account periods of insurance, employment or self-employment completed in other EU countries

- Social security contributions – if you are employed under labour contract, the contributions are deducted directly from your wages; if you are not, you have pay the contributions yourself – ask the local office of the Social Security Administration [Okresní správa sociálního zabezpečení]

- In some cases you may be asked by social security institution or Labour Office to fill in a questionnaire to find out what your country of residence is

- You may ask the Social Security Administration for more information on pensions (retirement or invalidity), sickness benefits, maternity or paternity benefits; or the Labour Office for more information on unemployment benefits, family benefits, assistance in material need

- If you terminate your work in one country and plan to move to another, it is recommended to collect certificate proving the duration of your social insurance (ask labour authority office in the country of work)

- More information is available on the website of [Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs](https://www.mpsv.cz/web/en) or [Czech Social Security Administration](https://www.cssz.cz/web/en) [Česká správa sociálního zabezpečení] or contact [EURES ](https://www.uradprace.cz/web/en/eures)at local Labour Office

### Czech language courses

- You may visit language courses in integration centres for improvement language skills. Integration centres are located in every county. Contacts for individual branches and further information about their activities can be found at [www.integracnicentra.cz/?lang=en](http://www.integracnicentra.cz/?lang=en).

### Sale of goods and services

- Providers of goods and services may not discriminate against the service recipient/buyer on grounds of her nationality, if there is no objectively justifiable ground. If you feel discriminated, you may file a complaint to the [Czech Trade Inspection Authority [Česká obchodní inspekce]](http://www.coi.cz/en).

- Provision of financial services (loan, mortgage, insurance) has its specificities. In case of discrimination, you may file a complaint to the [Czech National Bank](https://www.cnb.cz/en/supervision-financial-market/consumer-protection-and-financial-literacy/consumer-protection/index.html) [Česká národní banka] ([www.cnb.cz/en](http://www.cnb.cz/en) &rarr; Supervision, regulation &rarr; Consumer protection and financial literacy &rarr; Consumer protection), or in case of consumer credit provided by non-bank consumer credit providers to Czech Trade Inspection Authority [Česká obchodní inspekce].

- It is important that everyone who legally resides in the Czech Republic or another EU country has the right to opening one basic payment [account](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/financial-products-and-services/bank-accounts-eu/index_en.htm).

### Taxes

- Payment of income taxes depends on whether you are a tax resident or tax non-resident. If you are a Czech **tax resident**, you have unlimited tax obligation, i.e. you are taxed on your worldwide income. If you are a Czech **tax non-resident**, you are taxed only on your Czech-source income.

- It is not always easy to determine tax residency. The rules are to be found in the Act on Income Taxes [zákon o daních z příjmů]. If you are a tax resident of more countries, take a look in the treaty on avoidance of double taxation between the respective country and the Czech Republic, the list is available [here](https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/legislativa/dvoji-zdaneni/prehled-platnych-smluv), only in Czech ([https://www.mfcr.cz/en/](https://www.mfcr.cz/en/) &rarr; Themes &rarr; Taxes &rarr; Double taxation).

- Tax residency is usually determined according to this criteria (successively): 1. permanent home, 2. centre of vital interests, 3. habitual residence (in the Czech Republic at least 183 days in a year), 4. state citizenship. If you live and work in the Czech Republic for the whole year, you will most probably be Czech tax resident. But it depends on several circumstances, so in case of doubt is better to find professional assistance.

- Income tax obligation is usually different if you are an employee or if you are self-employed.

- If you live and work in the territory of the Czech Republic, you usually have to pay income tax from your salary or wages. If you are employed, your employer usually deducts the advance income tax. You may ask the employer to make annual statement of tax [roční zúčtování daně] (every year till 15th February), or you may file a tax declaration [daňové přiznání] yourself (every year till 1st April). If you are self-employed, you have to file the tax declaration yourself.

- For more information visit Your Europe [website](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/taxes/income-taxes-abroad/czechia/index_en.htm) ([https://europa.eu/youreurope/](https://europa.eu/youreurope/) &rarr; Citizens &rarr; Work &amp; Retirement &rarr; Taxes &rarr; Income taxes abroad) or contact [financial administration bodies](https://www.financnisprava.cz/en/financial-administration/financial-administration-bodies) ([www.financnisprava.cz](http://www.financnisprava.cz/) English version &rarr; Financial Administration &rarr; Financial Administration Bodies).

- In any case, we recommend you to ask a tax adviser for help. The list of income tax advisers, who speak English, is available [here](https://www.kdpcr.cz/seznam-danovych-poradcu/dan-z-prijmu-fyzickych-osob/dan-z-prijmu-pravnickych-osob/anglictina/).

### Education and schools

- There are two types of school in the Czech Republic – public and private.

- Public schools (elementary, high, [college](http://www.msmt.cz/areas-of-work/tertiary-education/czech-education-system)) are free of charge. Kindergarten is usually not free of charge. You should count with other expenses for snacks and lunches anyway.

- Private schools are not free of charge. School fees are different in each school.

- It may be rather difficult to find a suitable school for your children. If there more than one schools (nursery schools, elementary school) in your city, the city has a duty to define school districts. For each school district one local school [spádová škola] is given. Children resident in school district of the local school have priority in enrolment procedure. Ask the municipality authority, which school in the city is your local school.

- [Preschool education](http://www.msmt.cz/areas-of-work/preschool-education) – Preschool education is the initial level of public education organised and governed by the requirements and instructions of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports [Ministerstvo školství, mládeže a tělovýchovy]. Last year of nursery school is called pre-school year. Every pre-school child is obliged to attend the kindergarten and the municipalities guarantee a place for your child. Otherwise, this child will not be allowed to attend the first year of elementary school. ([www.msmt.cz](http://www.msmt.cz/) &rarr; Areas of Work &rarr; Preschool Education)

- Elementary school – Children in the Czech Republic are obliged to attend the elementary for 9 years (usually between 6-15 y.).

- High school – there are several types of high schools. For more information, visit this [website](https://www.studyin.cz/soubory/clanky/0021_publications/StudyIN-EduSystem-2017.pdf) ([www.studyin.cz](http://www.studyin.cz/)).

- Universities – For more information about tertiary education, visit this [website](http://www.msmt.cz/areas-of-work/tertiary-education/czech-education-system) ([www.msmt.cz](http://www.msmt.cz/)  Areas of Work &rarr; Tertiary Education &rarr; Czech education system). The list of Czech universities is available [here](https://portal.studyin.cz/find-your-institution/).

- For those children, whose mother tongue is other language than Czech (children with different mother tongue, in Czech „děti s OMJ“), there are several supportive measures. The aim of supportive measures is to adapt children’s education in the Czech Republic. For more information, ask [Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports](http://www.msmt.cz/ministry) [Ministerstvo školství, mládeže a tělovýchovy].

### Housing

- There are two types of housing in the Czech Republic – private and council housing

- It is important to report your residence to the appropriate Foreign Police Department that holds jurisdiction in the location of your stay in the Czech Republic (Policie ČR, [odbor cizinecké policie](https://www.policie.cz/clanek/oddeleni-pobytovych-agend.aspx)).

- You can also buy own house/flat or you can eventually rent one. There are lot of websites, where you can find some accommodation. There are also many real estate agencies, which could help you find suitable accommodation. Services of real estate agencies are paid. For this reason, you should ask about their prices in advance.

- Rent arises from the lease contract between the landlord and the tenant (you). The Czech Civil Code protects rights of tenants.

- If you wish to purchase real estate, you can ask a bank, which offers mortgage services.

- Some cities offer council housing too. Council housing is mainly offered to people with a lower income. For this reason, the council housing is usually cheaper. You may ask the municipal authority in your city, if they also offer council housing and on what conditions.

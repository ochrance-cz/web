<p>
<strong>We also help citizens of other EU countries who live in Czechia</strong></p>
<p>You can write to us if you have a problem related to moving to another country, e.g. if you feel discriminated against, your employer violates your rights or if the authorities do not take into account documents from foreign institutions</p>
<p>We can help you with your problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>with the authorities or municipalities</li>
<li>at work</li>
<li>at school or when studying</li>
<li>in health care, housing or other services</li></ul>
<p>if you are</p>
<ul>
<li>citizen of a European Union member state</li>
<li>or citizen of Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland</li></ul>
<p>and if you</p>
<ul>
<li>live or work in Czechia,</li>
<li>plan to move here,</li>
<li>or have lived in Czechia before</li></ul>

<h4>
<i>Case examples</i></h4>
<p>I live in Poland with my family, but I commute to Czechia for work. The tax office did not recognize documents issued by the Polish authorities. I contacted the Ombudsman and finally the tax office acknowledged their mistake and I saved money on taxes as a result.</p>
<p>I moved in with my boyfriend to neighbouring village and I wanted to apply for a job at the municipal office there. I wasn't sure if it was okay that my permanent residence was still in Slovakia, as I have only lived in Czechia for 4 years. I consulted the Ombudsman and thanks to that I know that I can apply for a job because my citizenship and type of residence in Czechia are not important when looking for a job.</p>
<p>My wife needed treatment and surgery in hospital. They did not want to do it because she is not Czech. I consulted the Ombudsman and then sent the hospital his legal opinion that they are not allowed to impose such a condition. Eventually everything was resolved.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Our work</h4>
<ul>
<li>When a person contacts us with a problem, we advise them on how they can effectively solve the it</li>
<li>When the complaint concerns an authority, we can inquire its actions. If the complaint concerns somebody else (employer, school, hospital, other company), we can invite them to comment on the matter and then assess whether there has been discrimination on grounds of nationality</li>
<li>If the problem stems from legislation or the authority's internal rules, we can try to change these rules</li>
<li>We carry out research, issue reports and make recommendations in areas related to migration in the European Union</li>
<li>We cooperate with foreign or international bodies that have similar tasks to the Ombudsman</li></ul>
<h4>Why is our work important</h4>
<p>EU citizenship gives people the right to have the same rights as local people in other EU countries. No one should be treated worse by the authorities or by different companies (for example, employers) for being a foreigner, unless there is an objective reason.</p>
<p>The EU has made sure that there is a designated body in each country to help EU citizens. A list of these is available at the&nbsp; 
<a href="https://employment-social-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies-and-activities/moving-working-europe/working-another-eu-country/free-movement-eu-nationals/how-enforce-your-rights/bodies-promoting-equal-treatment-and-supporting-workers-european-union-and-their-family-members_en">European Commission</a> website. The Ombudsman is the designated body in Czechia.</p>
<p>For more information on how the Ombudsman can help you, see the leaflet on&nbsp; 
<a href="https://www.ochrance.cz/en/situace/citizens-of-the-european-union/">helping EU citizens</a> or other leaflets&nbsp; 
<a href="https://www.ochrance.cz/en/situace/other-situations/">for foreigners</a> (also in other languages).&nbsp;</p>

<a href="https://ipc.gov.cz/en/obligations-for-foreigners/arrival-in-the-czech-republic-eu/">enter</a> freely the&nbsp;territory of&nbsp;Czechia and enjoy freedom of&nbsp;movement here. It&nbsp;is sufficient to&nbsp;travel with a&nbsp;valid ID&nbsp;card and/or a&nbsp;passport. ( 
<a href="https://ipc.gov.cz/en/">https://ipc.gov.cz/en/</a> → Obligations →EU Citizens and their Family Members → Arrival to the Czech Republic)</li>
<li>
<strong>Refusal of&nbsp;entry</strong>– The&nbsp;Police of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic may refuse your entry into the&nbsp;territory of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic. They may do&nbsp;so for instance in&nbsp;cases when you have no&nbsp;valid travel document (passport or&nbsp;ID card) and are unable to&nbsp;prove your identity by&nbsp;another document. Another example is&nbsp;if an&nbsp;alert has been issued with respect to&nbsp;you in&nbsp;the&nbsp;national records of&nbsp;undesirable persons and if&nbsp;reasonable danger pertains that you might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;threat to&nbsp;the&nbsp;security of&nbsp;the&nbsp;state or&nbsp;seriously impede public policy of&nbsp;the&nbsp;state. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule the&nbsp;Police has to&nbsp;issue a&nbsp;decision on&nbsp;refusal of&nbsp;entry. There are only a&nbsp;few exemptions to&nbsp;this rule.</li>
<li>In case you intend to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic for a&nbsp;period&nbsp; 
<strong>longer than 30&nbsp;days</strong>, you have to&nbsp;register your stay at&nbsp;the&nbsp;Police of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic.

<a href="https://ipc.gov.cz/en/">https://ipc.gov.cz/en/</a> → Visa and residence permit types → EU Citizens and Their Family Members → Permanent Residence of an EU Citizen). In&nbsp;some cases you may file an&nbsp;application for permanent residence permit even sooner than that (e.&nbsp;g. in&nbsp;case you are a&nbsp;spouse of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Czech national).</li>
<li>
<strong>Application forms</strong>&nbsp;have to&nbsp;be filled&nbsp; 
<strong>in in&nbsp;Czech</strong>&nbsp;(or Slovak) language.

<strong>Refusal to&nbsp;issue or&nbsp;revocation</strong>&nbsp; 
<strong>of a&nbsp;permanent residence permit</strong>&nbsp;– the&nbsp;Ministry of&nbsp;Interior may refuse to issue or&nbsp;revoke&nbsp;your permanent residence permit.

<li>
<strong>Entry</strong>&nbsp;– when arriving at&nbsp;the&nbsp;territory of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic, it&nbsp;is distinguished whether family members come from a&nbsp;country with a&nbsp;visa duty to&nbsp;enter the&nbsp;Czech Republic or&nbsp;from a&nbsp;visa-free country. Citizens of&nbsp;certain states have duty to&nbsp;apply for a&nbsp;visa. The&nbsp;list of&nbsp;states with a&nbsp;visa duty is available on the

<li>
<strong>Family member with a&nbsp;visa duty</strong>&nbsp;– you have to&nbsp;lodge an&nbsp;application in&nbsp;person at&nbsp;the&nbsp;embassy of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic (or at&nbsp;an&nbsp;embassy which represents the&nbsp;embassy of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic) in&nbsp;the&nbsp;state of&nbsp;your citizenship or&nbsp;in a&nbsp;state which granted him permanent residence permit. There is&nbsp;an&nbsp; 
<a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2010-429">exception </a>for the&nbsp;citizens of&nbsp;the&nbsp;following states who may lodge an&nbsp;application for a&nbsp;visa at&nbsp; 
<strong>any</strong>&nbsp;embassy of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic. Once the&nbsp;embassy receives your application, it&nbsp;will determine the&nbsp;date of&nbsp;a&nbsp;meeting. Please check at&nbsp;the&nbsp;embassy whether you have to&nbsp;be accompanied by&nbsp;an&nbsp;interpreter from your language before you go&nbsp;to that meeting. In&nbsp;case the&nbsp;closest embassy is&nbsp;too far away from your place of&nbsp;residence, when lodging your application you may request that further communication with you is&nbsp;by e-mail.</li></ul>
<p>The embassy has to&nbsp;issue a&nbsp;decision on&nbsp;your application within 14&nbsp;days.&nbsp;</p>

<li>
<strong>Refusal of&nbsp;entry</strong>&nbsp;– in&nbsp;exceptional cases it&nbsp;may happen that the&nbsp;police refuses your entry in&nbsp;the&nbsp;territory and shall annul your visa. Refusals of&nbsp;entry are most common due to&nbsp;the&nbsp;fact that a&nbsp;foreigner has not submitted a&nbsp;valid visa or&nbsp;residence permit (while being from a&nbsp;state with a&nbsp;visa duty). Another reasons for refusal of&nbsp;entry are that there is&nbsp;reasonable danger that you might represents a&nbsp;danger for public policy or&nbsp;public security for the&nbsp;state or&nbsp;another state. Another reason for a&nbsp;refusal of&nbsp;entry may be&nbsp;the&nbsp;fact that you do&nbsp;not have a&nbsp;valid travel document (passport or&nbsp;ID) and cannot prove your identity by&nbsp;another document.</li>
<li>
<strong>After arrival to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic</strong>, it&nbsp;is necessary that you report at&nbsp;the&nbsp;department of&nbsp;Foreign Police [

<li>
<strong>Temporary stay</strong>&nbsp;– As&nbsp;a&nbsp;family member of&nbsp;an&nbsp;EU&nbsp;citizen, you have to&nbsp;lodge an&nbsp;application for a&nbsp;residence permit for temporary stay within three months from their arrival to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic, if&nbsp;your stay exceeds three months. The&nbsp;application has to&nbsp;be lodged at&nbsp;the&nbsp;competent local subsidiary of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Department of&nbsp;Asylum and Migration Policy of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Ministry of&nbsp;Interior (further information is available on the

<h3>Health insurance and health care</h3>
<ul>
<li>Health care – as&nbsp;an&nbsp;EU&nbsp;citizen you have the&nbsp;right for the&nbsp;same health care as&nbsp;Czech citizens</li>
<li>You may file a&nbsp;complaint if&nbsp;you are not satisfied with the&nbsp;quality of&nbsp;health care that you received or&nbsp;with the&nbsp;conduct of&nbsp;medical staff. More information&nbsp;can be found in our t 
<a href="https://www.ochrance.cz/en/letaky/en-healthcare-complaints/EN-Healthcare-complaints.pdf">ext Healthcare: Complaints involving healthcare</a>.</li>
<li>You may be&nbsp;insured in&nbsp;public health insurance system only in&nbsp;one European Union country</li>
<li>The country of&nbsp;insurance is&nbsp;the&nbsp;country where you work either as&nbsp;an&nbsp;employee or&nbsp;as a&nbsp;self-employed person (with the&nbsp;exception of&nbsp;temporary posting of&nbsp;workers or&nbsp;seasonal workers, special rules apply to&nbsp;frontier workers)</li>
<li>If you are not an&nbsp;employee nor a&nbsp;self-employed person, your country of&nbsp;insurance is&nbsp;most probably the&nbsp;country where you habitually reside, more information can be found on 
<a href="https://kancelarzp.cz/en/temporary-stay-in-cz/eu-insured-persons/">the website Health Insurance Bureau</a>&nbsp;( 
<a href="https://kancelarzp.cz/en/homepage/">https://kancelarzp.cz/en/homepage/</a> → Temporary stay in&nbsp;CZ → EU&nbsp;insured person)</li>
<li>Health insurance premium –&nbsp;if&nbsp;you are employed under labour contract, the&nbsp;premium is&nbsp;deducted directly from your wages (work under agreement to&nbsp;complete a&nbsp;job or&nbsp;agreement to&nbsp;perform work is&nbsp;not considered as&nbsp;work under labour contract); if&nbsp;you are not, you have to&nbsp;pay the&nbsp;premium yourself – ask your health insurance company</li>
<li>If you are insured in&nbsp;another EU&nbsp;country, upon presentation of&nbsp;EHIC card (blue card proving public health insurance in&nbsp;EU) you are entitled to&nbsp;necessary health care in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic</li>
<li>You have to&nbsp;notify your health insurance company about all changes of&nbsp;personal data (name and surname, address, change of&nbsp;employment)</li>
<li>Some insurance companies offer also private health insurance, but that does not necessarily cover all health care and usually is&nbsp;less advantageous than public health insurance</li>
<li>If you terminate your work in&nbsp;one country and plan to&nbsp;move to&nbsp;another, it&nbsp;is recommended to&nbsp;collect certificate proving the&nbsp;duration of&nbsp;your health insurance</li>

<h3>Social security</h3>
<ul>
<li>In order to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;easier for EU&nbsp;citizens to&nbsp;move and work abroad, EU&nbsp;has adopted rules for determination which country is&nbsp;responsible for payment of&nbsp;social security benefits</li>
<li>Under these rules you may be&nbsp;subject to&nbsp;legislation of&nbsp;only one country – the&nbsp;country of&nbsp;insurance</li>
<li>The country of&nbsp;insurance is&nbsp;the&nbsp;country where you work either as&nbsp;an&nbsp;employee or&nbsp;as a&nbsp;self-employed person (with the&nbsp;exception of&nbsp;temporary posting of&nbsp;workers or&nbsp;seasonal workers, special rules apply to&nbsp;frontier workers). If&nbsp;you don’t&nbsp;work, the&nbsp;country of&nbsp;insurance is&nbsp;usually the&nbsp;country of&nbsp;your residence</li>
<li>In the&nbsp;country of&nbsp;insurance you should have equal access to&nbsp;social security contributions as&nbsp;its citizens</li>
<li>When deciding about your entitlement to&nbsp;social security benefits, the&nbsp;competent institution takes into account periods of&nbsp;insurance, employment or&nbsp;self-employment completed in&nbsp;other EU&nbsp;countries</li>
<li>Social security contributions –&nbsp;if&nbsp;you are employed under labour contract, the&nbsp;contributions are deducted directly from your wages; if&nbsp;you are not, you have pay the&nbsp;contributions yourself – ask the&nbsp;local office of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Social Security Administration [Okresní správa sociálního zabezpečení]</li>
<li>In some cases you may be&nbsp;asked by&nbsp;social security institution or&nbsp;Labour Office to&nbsp;fill in&nbsp;a&nbsp;questionnaire to&nbsp;find out what your country of&nbsp;residence is</li>
<li>You may ask the&nbsp;Social Security Administration for more information on&nbsp;pensions (retirement or&nbsp;invalidity), sickness benefits, maternity or&nbsp;paternity benefits; or&nbsp;the&nbsp;Labour Office for more information on&nbsp;unemployment benefits, family benefits, assistance in&nbsp;material need</li>
<li>If you terminate your work in&nbsp;one country and plan to&nbsp;move to&nbsp;another, it&nbsp;is recommended to&nbsp;collect certificate proving the&nbsp;duration of&nbsp;your social insurance (ask labour authority office in&nbsp;the&nbsp;country of&nbsp;work)</li>

<h3>Sale of goods and services</h3>
<ul>
<li>Providers of&nbsp;goods and services may not discriminate against the&nbsp;service recipient/buyer on&nbsp;grounds of&nbsp;her nationality, if&nbsp;there is&nbsp;no objectively justifiable ground. If&nbsp;you feel discriminated, you may file a&nbsp;complaint to&nbsp;the&nbsp; 
<a href="http://www.coi.cz/en">Czech Trade Inspection Authority [Česká obchodní inspekce]</a>.</li>
<li>Provision of&nbsp;financial services (loan, mortgage, insurance) has its specificities. In&nbsp;case of&nbsp;discrimination, you may file a&nbsp;complaint to&nbsp;the&nbsp;

<h3>Taxes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Payment of&nbsp;income taxes depends on&nbsp;whether you are a&nbsp;tax resident or&nbsp;tax non-resident. If&nbsp;you are a&nbsp;Czech&nbsp; 
<strong>tax resident</strong>, you have unlimited tax obligation, i.e. you are taxed on&nbsp;your worldwide income. If&nbsp;you are a&nbsp;Czech&nbsp; 
<strong>tax non-resident</strong>, you are taxed only on&nbsp;your Czech-source income.</li>
<li>It is&nbsp;not always easy to&nbsp;determine tax residency. The&nbsp;rules are to&nbsp;be found in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Act on&nbsp;Income Taxes [zákon o&nbsp;daních z&nbsp;příjmů]. If&nbsp;you are a&nbsp;tax resident of&nbsp;more countries, take a&nbsp;look in&nbsp;the&nbsp;treaty on&nbsp;avoidance of&nbsp;double taxation between the&nbsp;respective country and the&nbsp;Czech Republic, see 
<a href="https://www.mfcr.cz/en/eu-and-international-affairs/double-tax-agreements">the&nbsp;list</a> ( 
<a href="https://www.mfcr.cz/en/">https://www.mfcr.cz/en/</a>&nbsp;→ EU and International Affairs → Double Tax Agreements).</li>
<li>Tax residency is&nbsp;usually determined according to&nbsp;this criteria (successively): 1.&nbsp;permanent home, 2.&nbsp;centre of&nbsp;vital interests, 3.&nbsp;habitual residence (in the&nbsp;Czech Republic at&nbsp;least 183&nbsp;days in&nbsp;a&nbsp;year), 4.&nbsp;state citizenship. If&nbsp;you live and work in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic for the&nbsp;whole year, you will most probably be&nbsp;Czech tax resident. But it&nbsp;depends on&nbsp;several circumstances, so&nbsp;in case of&nbsp;doubt is&nbsp;better to&nbsp;find professional assistance.</li>
<li>Income tax obligation is&nbsp;usually different if&nbsp;you are an&nbsp;employee or&nbsp;if you are self-employed.</li>
<li>If you live and work in&nbsp;the&nbsp;territory of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic, you usually have to&nbsp;pay income tax from your salary or&nbsp;wages. If&nbsp;you are employed, your employer usually deducts the&nbsp;advance income tax. You may ask the&nbsp;employer to&nbsp;make annual statement of&nbsp;tax [roční zúčtování daně] (every year till 15th February), or&nbsp;you may file a&nbsp;tax declaration [daňové přiznání] yourself (every year till 1st April). If&nbsp;you are self-employed, you have to&nbsp;file the&nbsp;tax declaration yourself.</li>

<li>In any case, we&nbsp;recommend you to&nbsp;ask a&nbsp;tax adviser for help. Income tax advisers, who speak English, is available in 
<a href="https://www.kdpcr.cz/seznam-danovych-poradcu/dan-z-prijmu-fyzickych-osob/dan-z-prijmu-pravnickych-osob/anglictina/">the list</a>.</li></ul>
<h3>Education and schools</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are two types of&nbsp;school in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic – public and private.</li>
<li>Public schools (elementary, high,&nbsp; 
<a href="http://www.msmt.cz/areas-of-work/tertiary-education/czech-education-system">college</a>) are free of&nbsp;charge. Kindergarten is&nbsp;usually not free of&nbsp;charge. You should count with other expenses for snacks and lunches anyway.</li>
<li>Private schools are not free of&nbsp;charge. School fees are different in&nbsp;each school.</li>
<li>It may be&nbsp;rather difficult to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;suitable school for your children. If&nbsp;there more than one schools (nursery schools, elementary school) in&nbsp;your city, the&nbsp;city has a&nbsp;duty to&nbsp;define school districts. For each school district one local school [spádová škola] is&nbsp;given. Children resident in&nbsp;school district of&nbsp;the&nbsp;local school have priority in&nbsp;enrolment procedure. Ask the&nbsp;municipality authority, which school in&nbsp;the&nbsp;city is&nbsp;your local school.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.msmt.cz/areas-of-work/preschool-education">Preschool education</a>&nbsp;– Preschool education is&nbsp;the&nbsp;initial level of&nbsp;public education organised and governed by&nbsp;the&nbsp;requirements and instructions of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Ministry of&nbsp;Education, Youth and Sports [Ministerstvo školství, mládeže a&nbsp;tělovýchovy]. Last year of&nbsp;nursery school is&nbsp;called pre-school year. Every pre-school child is&nbsp;obliged to&nbsp;attend the&nbsp;kindergarten and the&nbsp;municipalities guarantee a&nbsp;place for your child. Otherwise, this child will not be&nbsp;allowed to&nbsp;attend the&nbsp;first year of&nbsp;elementary school. ( 
<a href="http://www.msmt.cz/">www.msmt.cz</a>&nbsp;→ Areas of&nbsp;Work → Preschool Education)</li>
<li>Elementary school – Children in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic are obliged to&nbsp;attend the&nbsp;elementary for 9&nbsp;years (usually between 6-15 y.).</li>
<li>High school – there are several types of&nbsp;high schools. For more information, visit this&nbsp;

<h3>Housing</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are two types of&nbsp;housing in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic – private and council housing</li>
<li>It is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;report your residence to&nbsp;the&nbsp;appropriate Foreign Police Department that holds jurisdiction in&nbsp;the&nbsp;location of&nbsp;your stay in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Czech Republic (Policie ČR,&nbsp; 
<a href="https://www.policie.cz/clanek/oddeleni-pobytovych-agend.aspx">odbor cizinecké policie</a>).</li>
<li>You can also buy own house/flat or&nbsp;you can eventually rent one. There are lot of&nbsp;websites, where you can find some accommodation. There are also many real estate agencies, which could help you find suitable accommodation. Services of&nbsp;real estate agencies are paid. For this reason, you should ask about their prices in&nbsp;advance.</li>
<li>Rent arises from the&nbsp;lease contract between the&nbsp;landlord and the&nbsp;tenant (you). The&nbsp;Czech Civil Code protects rights of&nbsp;tenants.</li>
<li>If you wish to&nbsp;purchase real estate, you can ask a&nbsp;bank, which offers mortgage services.</li>
<li>Some cities offer council housing too. Council housing is&nbsp;mainly offered to&nbsp;people with a&nbsp;lower income. For this reason, the&nbsp;council housing is&nbsp;usually cheaper. You may ask the&nbsp;municipal authority in&nbsp;your city, if&nbsp;they also offer council housing and on&nbsp;what conditions.</li>

<h3>Registration of vehicles and driving licences</h3>
<p>Driving licences issued in one country of the&nbsp;European Union are automatically recognized in other EU countries. If you move to another EU country for a&nbsp;period longer than 6&nbsp;months, you are obliged to register your vehicle in the&nbsp;new country. Deadlines for registration depend on each country, in the&nbsp;Czech Republic it is 10&nbsp;workdays. Registration is carried out by local municipal authority [obecní úřad obce s rozšířenou působností] in the&nbsp;place of your residence. The&nbsp;registration of a&nbsp;vehicle is connected with the&nbsp;obligation to have compulsory third party liability insurance valid in the&nbsp;country where you reside. You may find more information

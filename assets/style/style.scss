CSS style guide

- Styles use cascade.
- Basic styles are applied to the element_name selectors.
- Root classes always start with underscore (_example).
  Root classes are commonly applied to partial layouts
  and match their names (see layouts/partials).
- Multiple root classes can be created in one module:
  keep BEM style double-dash submodule convention (_typo--small).
- Other classes never start with underscore.
